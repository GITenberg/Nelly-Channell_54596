<p class="chapter_name">THE HOME AT HUNTSDEAN AND ITS
NEW INMATES.</p>

<p><span class = "smcap">It</span> was the dreariest of November days. The
only bright spot was a crimson sumach, spreading
its gorgeous foliage against the watery grey
of the sky, and misty back-ground of fog-hidden
fields. It was a day that made the burdens of
life seem heavier than they really were, and
set the heart aching for the sunshine of the
vanished summer.</p>

<p>The scene was as still as death. There was
not wind enough to lift the pale vapours that
hung over the meadows. No kindly breezes
came to the poor brown leaves, heaped on the
wayside, and carried them off to quiet hollows
where they might have decent burial. Better
rain and tempest than such a gloomy calm as
this; and better the roar and rattle of the train<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span>
than the heavy jog-trot of the carrier’s horses,
and the rumble of his wagon.</p>

<p>“It will never be the same home again,” said
Rhoda Farren to herself, as the old grey cottage
came in sight. There was the low, moss-grown
wall, built of flints&mdash;there were the splendid
sumachs, brightening the desolate garden.
Rhoda and her cousin Helen had chased each
other along those grassy paths when they were
children. But they were women now, and had
put away childish things. Rhoda loved her
cousin reasonably well, yet not well enough to
give up her own bedroom to her and her baby.</p>

<p>The baby was the principal grievance.
Rhoda had had very little to do with children;
and being of a studious turn, she did not want
to improve her acquaintance with them. In
reading her favourite books she always skipped
the parts that related their sayings and doings.
It was, therefore, no small cross to find an infant
of two months old introduced into the
family circle. For there she had hoped to reign
supreme.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span></p>

<p>She had a presentiment that there would be
rivalry between the baby and herself&mdash;a struggle
for mastery, in which her little opponent
might possibly be victor. “Baby lips would
laugh her down,” if she attempted remonstrance.
Even parents and a fond brother
might be won over to the cause of the small
usurper.</p>

<p>For three years Rhoda Farren had been
living away from home, only coming back for a
fortnight at Christmas, and sometimes for a few
days in midsummer. Neighbours and friends
had looked upon her as fortunate. She had
held the post of companion to the rich widow of
a London merchant, and had been well treated,
and not ill remunerated.</p>

<p>The widow was lately dead, and Miss Farren
was returning to her home with an annuity of
twenty pounds, to be paid regularly by Mrs.
Elton’s executors.</p>

<p>Mrs. Elton had not been difficult to live with;
and her companion had adapted herself to her
ways more readily than most girls of twenty<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
would have done. The quiet house in Cavendish
Square had been no uncheerful home.
But the mode of life there had strengthened
Rhoda’s habits of self-indulgence. She had
had ample time for reading and musing. No
harsh words had chafed her temper, no small
nuisances had planted thorns in her path.
They had few visitors. Weeks would pass
without their hearing other voices than those of
the servants. It did not matter to them that
there were mighty things done in the great
world. It was an unwholesome life for two
women to lead&mdash;a life of cramped interests and
narrow thoughts.</p>

<p>Helen had been living in Islington, while
Rhoda was in Cavendish Square. But in those
days Miss Farren never went to see anybody;
and she excused herself for not visiting Helen
by saying that Mrs. Elton did not like her to
be gadding about. Thus it came to pass that
she had not even once seen her cousin’s husband.</p>

<p>She knew that Robert Clarris had taken<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>
Helen from her situation of nursery governess,
and had married her after a brief acquaintance.
Rhoda’s parents were Helen’s only surviving
relatives, and they had given their full consent
to the match. It was not a bad match for a
penniless girl to make; for Robert Clarris was
a confidential clerk in the office of Mr. Elton,
son of the widow in Cavendish Square.</p>

<p>It was in July that Mrs. Elton’s health began
to fail. Rhoda Farren saw the change
stealing over her day by day, and knew what it
portended. In a certain way she had been fond
of the old woman; but it was an attachment
without love. There would be no great pain
when the ties between them were broken, and
Rhoda was conscious of this. She was even
angry with herself for not being more sorry
that Mrs. Elton was dying.</p>

<p>“The worry of life is wearing me out,
Rhoda,” said the widow one day, when Miss
Farren had found her violently agitated, and in
tears. It surprised her not a little to hear that
Mrs. Elton had any worries. But when the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
wind shakes the full tree, there is always a
great rustling of the leaves. The bare bough
does not quake; it has nothing to lose. Mrs.
Elton had been a rich woman from her youth
upward, and she could not bear that a single
leaf should be torn from her green branches.</p>

<p>“I have had a dreadful loss, Rhoda,” she
continued; “a loss in my business. The business
is mine, you know. I always said my son
should never have it while I was alive. But
of course I have let him carry it on for me,
and very badly he has managed! That confidential
clerk of his&mdash;Clarris&mdash;has robbed me of
three hundred pounds!”</p>

<p>“You surely don’t mean my cousin Helen’s
husband, Mrs. Elton?” cried Rhoda.</p>

<p>“How should I know anything about his
being your cousin’s husband?” said the old
lady peevishly. <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>“His wife is a very unlucky
woman, whoever she is. Three hundred pounds
have been paid into Clarris’s hands for me, and
he has embezzled every shilling of it. My son
always had a ridiculous habit of petting the
people he employed. This is what has come
of it.”</p>

<p>“Is he in prison?” faltered Rhoda.</p>

<p>“No; I am sorry to say that he isn’t. Those
lazy idiots, the detectives, have let him slip.
He has had the impertinence to write a canting
letter to my son, telling him that every farthing
shall be restored.”</p>

<p>The fugitive was not captured. Perhaps Mr.
Elton had a secret liking for the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">ci-devant</i> clerk,
and did not care to have him too hotly pursued.
Poor lonely Helen had travelled without
delay to her uncle’s house, and there her little
girl had entered this troublesome world. At
the end of October Mrs. Elton had ceased to
fret for the three hundred pounds, and had gone
where gold and silver are of small account.
And on this November afternoon Rhoda Farren
had returned to her old home once more.</p>

<p>Bond, the carrier, had picked up Miss Farren
and her belongings when the train had set her
down at the rural railway station. Then came
the five mile drive to Huntsdean, over the roads<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
that she had often traversed in her girlhood.
The pallid mist clung to every branch of the
familiar trees, and veiled the woodland alleys
where she had watched the rabbits and squirrels
in bygone times. Not a gleam of sunshine
welcomed her back to the old haunts; not a
brown hare leaped across her path; not a bird
sent forth a note of welcome. Nature and
Rhoda were in the same mood on that memorable
day.</p>

<p>But if the whole scene had been radiant with
flowers, Rhoda would still have chosen to “sit
down upon her little handful of thorns.” She
told herself again and again that her good days
were done. Was she not coming home to find
the house invaded, and her own room occupied,
by the wife and child of a thief?</p>

<p>Yes, a thief. She called him that hard name
a dozen times, and even whispered it as she
sat under the wagon-tilt. It is a humbling fact,
that humanity finds relief in calling names.
Ay, it is a miserable thing to know that we
have fastened many a bitter epithet on some<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
whose names are written in the Book of
Life.</p>

<p>“Wo!” cried Bond to his horses.</p>

<p>The ejaculation might have been applied to
Rhoda; for it was a woful visage that emerged
from the tilt and met the gaze of John
Farren as he came out of the garden gate.</p>

<p>“You don’t look quite so young as you did,
Rhoda,” he said when he had lifted her from
the wagon and set her on her feet.</p>

<p>There are birds that pluck the feathers from
their own breasts. For hours Rhoda had been
silently graving lines upon her face, and deliberately
destroying the bloom and freshness that
God meant her to keep. But she did not like
to be told of her handiwork. When Miss So-and-so’s
friends remark that she is getting <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">passé</i>,
is it any comfort to her to know that her own
restless nature, and not Time, has deprived her
of her comeliness? Many a woman is lovelier
in her maturity than in her youth. But it is a
kind of beauty that comes with the knowledge
of <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>“the things that belong unto her peace.”</p>

<p>John looked after her boxes, and paid the
carrier. The wagon rumbled on through the
village, the black retriever barking behind it, to
the exasperation of Bond’s dog, which was
tethered under the wain. Then the brother put
his hands on his sister’s shoulders, glanced at
her earnestly for a moment, and kissed her.</p>

<p>“Mother’s waiting for you,” he said.</p>

<p>As he spoke, Mrs. Farren appeared in the
porch, and at the sight of her Rhoda’s ill-temper
was ready to take flight. But Helen was
behind her, waiting too&mdash;waiting to weary her
cousin with all the details of her wretched story,
and expecting her, perhaps, to pity Robert
Clarris.</p>

<p>“It’s good to have you back again, my dear,”
said the mother’s soft voice and glistening eyes.</p>

<p>“Ah, Rhoda!” piped Helen’s treble, “we
were children together, were we not? Oh!
what sorrows I’ve gone through, and how I
have been longing to talk to you!”</p>

<p>Before Miss Farren could reply, a feeble wail
arose from the adjoining room. The baby had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
lost no time in announcing its presence, and
Helen hurried in to the cradle. Dim as the
light was, her mother must have detected the
annoyance on Rhoda’s face. Or perhaps her
quick instinct served her instead of sight, for
she hastened to say&mdash;</p>

<p>“It doesn’t often cry, poor little mite! But
it has been ailing to-day.”</p>

<p>There was only one flight of stairs in the
house. As Rhoda slowly ascended them, the
loud, steady ticking of the old clock brought
back many a childish memory. Would the
hours pass as swiftly and brightly as they had
done in earlier years? She sighed as she
thought of all the small miseries that would
make time hang heavily on her hands. It
never even occurred to her then that</p>

<p>A fretful spirit will spin hours out of minutes,
and weeks out of days.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span></p>

<p>“I told you, Rhoda, my dear, that we had
given your room to Helen. I said so in a
letter, didn’t I?” remarked Mrs. Farren, leading
the way into the chamber that she had prepared
for her daughter. “This is nearly as
good. And I felt sure that you would not
grudge the larger room to that poor thing and
her child.”</p>

<p>“What is to be, must be,” Rhoda replied.</p>

<p>“Don’t stop to unpack anything,” continued
her mother, trying not to notice the gloomy
answer. “Come downstairs again as soon as
you can. There’s a good fire, and a bit of
something nice for tea. It’s a kind of day that
takes the light and colour out of everything,”
she added, with a slight shiver. “I’ll never
grumble at the weather that God sends; yet
I’m always glad when we’ve got through
November.”</p>

<p>It was Rhoda who had brought the damp
mist indoors. It was Rhoda&mdash;God forgive her&mdash;who
had taken the light and colour out of
everything. In looking back upon our lives,
we must always see the dark spots where we
cast our shadow on another’s path&mdash;a path<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
which, perhaps, ran very close beside our own.
It may be that our dear ones, enfolded in the
sunlight of Paradise, have forgotten the gloom
that we once threw over their earthly way.
But we never can.</p>

<p>When Rhoda went down into the old parlour,
she found it glowing with fire and candle light.
Her father had come in from the wet fields and
the sheepfolds, and was waiting to give her a
welcome. Red curtains shut out the foggy
evening; red lights danced on the well-spread
table. The baby, lying open-eyed on Helen’s
lap, had its thumb in its mouth, and seemed
disposed for quiet contemplation. The black
retriever, stretched upon the hearth-rug, had
finished a hard day’s barking, and was taking
his well-earned repose.</p>

<p>They gave her the best chair and the
warmest seat. All that household love could
do was done; and she began to thaw a little
under its influence.</p>

<p>Once or twice Helen tried to introduce the
subject of her troubles, but the farmer and his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
wife quietly put it aside. Rhoda had made no
secret of her resentment. There were many
other things to be told; little episodes in village
lives; little stories of neighbours and friends.
The talk flowed on like a woodland stream that
glides over this obstacle and under that. It
was threading a difficult and intricate way, but
it kept on flowing, till night broke up the family
group.</p>

<p class="chapter_name">BROTHER AND SISTER.&mdash;RHODA FARREN
PERPLEXED.</p>


<p><span class = "smcap">The</span> father and mother retired first, then Helen.
John seated himself in the farmer’s large arm-chair,
and looked at Rhoda as she sat on the
other side of the fire. These after-supper talks
had been a custom with them in the old days.
The sister knew by her brother’s glance that he
understood her mood, and was prepared for a
long chat.</p>

<p>It is a trying thing for a woman that a man
will seldom begin a subject, however full his
heart may be of it. He will wait, with indomitable
patience, until she speaks the first word,
and after that he will go on glibly enough.
Rhoda first learned to understand something of
man’s nature by studying John, and she knew
perfectly well that she should never get a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
sentence out of him unless she broke the
silence.</p>

<p>“Well,” she said at last, with a little movement
of impatience, “this is a miserable business.
I never thought that I should come back
to the old home and find the wife and child of
a felon comfortably settled in it. But there is
no end to sin&mdash;no limit to the audacity of
criminals. It is not enough for Robert Clarris
to rob his employer, he must also thrust his own
lawful burdens on other folks’ shoulders.”</p>

<p>“When one commits a crime,” replied John
gravely, “one never foresees what it entails.
When Clarris found that discovery was inevitable,
he came home to his wife and asked her
to fly with him. But she would not go&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“How could she go?” interrupted Rhoda indignantly.
“Think of her condition, and of the
misery and disgrace of following his fortunes.
He is a base man indeed.”</p>

<p>John moved uneasily in his chair, and kept
his eyes fixed on the burning log in the grate.
More than once his lips opened and shut again.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span></p>

<p>“I suppose you’ll be very hard on me,” he
said at length, “if I own that I’ve a sort of
tenderness for this poor sinner. I don’t mean
to make light of his crime, but I believe that
when he took the money he intended to pay it
back.”</p>

<p>“Oh, John,” said Rhoda severely, “I am
really ashamed of you! What has come to
your moral perceptions? There is a saying that
the way to hell is paved with good intentions;&mdash;of
course this man will try to excuse himself.
The world has got into a habit of petting its
criminals, and it is one of the worst signs of the
times. As Mrs. Elton used to say, it would be
well if we could have the good old days back
again!”</p>

<p>“The good old days when men were hung
for sheep-stealing, and starving women were
sentenced to death for taking a loaf!” retorted
John with unusual heat. <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>“How I hate to hear
that cant about the good old days! And when
the gallows and the pillory and the stocks
were so busy, did they stop the Mohawks in
their fiendish pranks at night? or did they
put down the Gordon riots till the mob had
begun to sack and pillage London? I am glad
the world is changed, and I hope it will go on
changing.”</p>

<p>“If we change from over-severity to over-mercy,
we shall just have to go back to over-severity
again,” replied Rhoda.</p>

<p>“No, Rhoda,” he said more calmly. “By
that time we shall have got to the days ‘when
the earth shall be full of the knowledge of the
Lord as the waters cover the seas.’”</p>

<p>Rhoda looked at her brother and wondered.
These were strange words to hear from a young
man living in a Hampshire village, where everything
seemed to be standing still. There was
no more talk that night. It was evident to
Rhoda that John had shot ahead of her in the
road of life. Not being able to say whether he
were in a bad way or a good way, she said
nothing and went to bed.</p>

<p class="faux_h">CHAPTER <abbr title="3">III.</abbr></p>

<p class="chapter_name">A SPARED LIFE.&mdash;NEWS FROM ROBERT
CLARRIS.</p>


<p><span class = "smcap">A great</span> sorrow is like a mountain in our way:
we must either climb to its top, or lie grovelling
at its base. If we grovel, the path of life is
blocked up for ever, and the shadow of our
misery is upon us night and day. If we climb,
we shall find purer air and fairer regions.
Heaven will be nearer to us, the world will lie
beneath our feet;&mdash;we shall bless God for the
trial that has lifted us so high above our old
selves. We shall comprehend a little of the
vast Love that reared the mountain;&mdash;ay, we
shall break forth into singing, “Thou, Lord, of
Thy goodness, hast made my hill so strong!”</p>

<p>It was clear that Helen would never climb
her mountain. In the old days, although she
was three years older than her cousin, Rhoda<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
had found out that nothing would ever lift her
above the dead level of life. Always beautiful,
always common-place, always a little sly&mdash;such
were her childish characteristics, and they were
unaltered by time. Her beauty was of that
kind which inevitably gives a false impression.
Every smile was a poem; every glance seemed
to tell of thoughts too deep for words. She
was the very impersonation of the German Elle-maid&mdash;as
hollow a piece of loveliness as ever
sat by the roadside in the old <span lang = "de" xml:lang="de">Schwarzwald</span>,
and lured unwary travellers to accept the fatal
goblet or kiss.</p>

<p>When she said, tearfully, that Robert Clarris
had fallen in love at their first interview, and
would not rest till he had married her, Rhoda
knew that she spoke the simple truth. No one
who looked into the eloquent brown eyes, and
watched the play of the sweet lips, could marvel
at Robert’s impetuosity. One could understand
how that fair face had drawn out the old
Samson cry, <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>“Get her for me, for she pleaseth
me well.”</p>

<p>“I might have done far better, Rhoda,” she
said, plaintively; “but I had a hard situation,
and I wanted to get out of it. You don’t know
the misery of being nursery governess. One is
just like the bat in the fable, neither a bird
nor a beast&mdash;neither a lady nor a servant. The
position is bad enough for an ugly girl; but it
is ten times worse for a pretty one.”</p>

<p>No one could blame Helen for speaking of
her beauty as an established fact.</p>

<p>“When I was married to Robert,” she continued,
“I soon began to be disappointed in
him. There was an end to all the nice little
attentions. I was almost his goddess until I
became his wife.”</p>

<p>“Oh, that’s a very old story,” responded
Rhoda. “Lovers are just like our old apple
trees; one would think to see the quantity of
blossom that there would be a deal of fruit;
but there never is. Great promise and small
fulfilment&mdash;that’s always the case with men.”</p>

<p>“He was dreadfully stingy,” went on Helen.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>“He worried me sadly about my expenses. I
was not allowed enough money to keep myself
decently dressed. I think he liked to see me
shabby.”</p>

<p>“You are wearing a very good dress at this
moment,” remarked Rhoda.</p>

<p>“Yes, this is well enough,” answered her
cousin, colouring slightly. “I was obliged to
get things without his leave sometimes, or I
should have looked like a scarecrow. Robert
would never believe that I wanted any clothes.”</p>

<p>“What did he do with the money that he
stole?” Rhoda asked abruptly.</p>

<p>“How should I know?” sighed Helen. “He
never gave a shilling of it to me. One day he
came home and told me, quite suddenly, that
his sin must be discovered. I thought that he
was crazed, and when I found that he was in
his right mind, I nearly lost my senses. Never
get married, Rhoda; take my advice, and be a
single woman. It’s the only way to keep out
of misery.”</p>

<p>“I’m not thinking of marrying, Helen,” replied
Rhoda, rather sharply; <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>“but every marriage
is not such a mistake as yours has been.
God knew what He was about, I suppose, when
He brought Adam and Eve together. There’s
little sense in abusing a good road just because
you couldn’t walk upright on it.”</p>

<p>“You would not have found it easy to walk
with Robert,” said Helen, mournfully. “And
now he has gone off, and has left me sticking
in the mire! It’s worse than being a widow.”</p>

<p>Rhoda melted at once at the thought of
Helen’s desolate condition.</p>

<p>“Perhaps he may really get on in Australia,”
she rejoined, trying to speak hopefully; “and
then he may send for you and the child.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I hope not!” returned Helen, with a
little start. “If he gets on, he will send home
money for us; but I do not want to live with
him again.”</p>

<p>There can be no separation so utter and
hopeless as that which parts two who have
been made one. The closer the union, the
more complete is the disunion. Even at that
moment, when Rhoda’s wrath was hot against<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
Robert Clarris, she was struck with Helen’s
entire lack of wifely feeling. She could almost
have pitied the man who had so thoroughly
alienated the mother of his child. And then
she reflected that this dread of reunion on
Helen’s part told fearfully against him. Helen
was weak, but was she not also gentle and
affectionate? Better, indeed, was it for them
to keep asunder until another life should
present each to the other under a new aspect.</p>

<p>She did not pursue the subject further.
With a sudden desire to be away from Helen
and her troubles, she wrapped herself in a
thick shawl, and went up the fields that rose
behind the cottage. On the highest land the
farmer was mending a fence. She could hear
the strokes of his mallet as he drove the
stakes into the ground.</p>

<p>As Rhoda drew near, she stood still and
looked at him&mdash;a hale, handsome man, whose
face, fringed by an iron-grey beard, was like
a rosy russet apple set in grey lichen. His
smock-frock showed white against the dark<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
background of brown trees. The air was so
quiet that one could listen to his breathing
as his strong arms dealt the sturdy blows.</p>

<p>She was proud of him as she stood there
in the wide field watching him unseen. He
would leave her nothing save the legacy of
an unstained name, but the worth thereof was
far above rubies. No one would sneer at her
as the daughter of a disgraced man. No
one would whisper, “She comes of a bad
stock; take heed how you trust her.” Many
a rogue has wriggled out of well-earned
punishment with the aid of his sire’s good
name. Many an honest Christian has gone
groaning through life under the burden of a
parent’s evil reputation.</p>

<p>With this pride in him Rhoda was unconsciously
blending a pride in herself. “Some
eyes,” she thought, “are too blind to see their
blessings; I am quick of sight. The Author
and Giver of all good things finds in me a
grateful receiver.”</p>

<p>Thus she loudly echoed the Pharisee’s cry<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
“Lord, I thank Thee that I am not as other
men.” And never, perhaps, is the Divine
patience so severely tried as when that self-complacent
voice is heard. How sweet in
Christ’s ears must be those other voices&mdash;stealing
up to Him through the egotist’s loveless
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Te Deum</i>&mdash;breathing the publican’s old
prayer, “God be merciful to me a sinner!”</p>

<p>It was a day of sober brightness. A white
mist had risen above the western slopes, and
the setting sun shone through it. Brown
furrows had begun to take a rich auburn
tinge; tree-shadows crept farther and farther
across the green sod; crows flew heavily
homewards. From the wet thickets came the
old fresh ferny scents, sweetening the calm
air. The mallet blows ceased; the farmer
had ended his task, and turned towards his
daughter.</p>

<p>“You are not sorry to get back to our
fields, Rhoda?” he said. <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>“You’ll see the
primroses showing their pretty faces by-and-by.
Ah, it seems but yesterday that you
and Helen were filling your pinafores with
them!”</p>

<p>“Helen’s winter has come before its time,
father,” answered Miss Farren, gravely. “Her
wicked husband has made her life desolate.”</p>

<p>“And his own too,” added the farmer, in a
pitying tone.</p>

<p>“That is as it should be,” returned Rhoda,
quickly. “He has escaped the punishment
he merited; but there’s satisfaction in knowing
that God’s justice will surely reach him.”</p>

<p>“Ay,” murmured the farmer softly, “God’s
mercy will surely reach him.”</p>

<p>“God’s favour is for those who walk uprightly,”
said Rhoda.</p>

<p>“Ah, Rhoda, the mercy is granted before
they learn to walk uprightly,” replied her
father. <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>“It comes to those who have fallen
and are ready to perish. There are few of
us who can see ourselves in every criminal, as
old Baxter did. And there are fewer still who
can believe that a man may come out of the
Slough of Despond cleaner than he went in.”</p>

<p>They turned towards the house, walking
silently down the green slopes. Rhoda was
angry and perplexed; what was the use of
living a respectable life if sinners were to be
highly esteemed? When she spoke again it
was in a harsh tone.</p>

<p>“Robert Clarris has found defenders, it
seems! A man who has committed such a
crime as his should scarcely be so lightly
forgiven!”</p>

<p>“There is one thing I’d have you remember,
Rhoda,” said the farmer, patiently, “and that
is, the difference between falling into sin and
living in sin. It’s just the difference between
the man who loves and hugs his disease and
he who writhes under it, and longs to be cured.”</p>

<p>“Even supposing that this is Robert’s first
fault,” continued Miss Farren, “there must
have been a long course of unsteady walking
before such a fall could be brought about.”</p>

<p>“Maybe not,” her father responded. <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>“Some
men lose their characters, Rhoda, as others
lose their lives, by being off their guard for
one moment. And when you talk of God’s
justice, recollect that it means something very
different from man’s judgment. The Lord
hates the sin worse than we do, but He knows
what we can never know&mdash;the strength of the
temptation.”</p>

<p>By that time the pair had descended the
last slope, and were drawing near the cottage.
The back-door stood open. Rhoda could see
the red glow of the kitchen fire, and the outline
of her mother’s figure as she moved to
and fro. It was a pleasant glimpse of household
warmth and light, and it charmed her
ill temper away. But she did not remember
that there might be wanderers in the world
at that moment&mdash;driven out into life’s wilderness
by sin&mdash;whose hearts would well-nigh
break at this little glimpse of a home. She
did not think of that awful sense of loss which
crime must leave behind it. Perhaps that
open house-door had suggested thoughts like
these to the farmer, for he paused before they
entered.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span></p>

<p>“Rhoda,” he said, solemnly, “never fall into
the mistake of thinking that sinners aren’t
punished enough. It’s a very common blunder.
Many a man might have hanged himself, as
Judas did, if Christ hadn’t stepped in and
shown him what the atonement is. It is to
the Davids and Peters and Sauls that He
says, ‘Where sin abounded, grace did much
more abound.’”</p>

<p>November came to an end. December set
in with biting winds and gloomy skies, and
then followed a sharp, wintry Christmas.</p>

<p>It was a hard time for the birds. Rhoda
would sit at the window and watch them
congregating on the brier-bush in the corner
of the garden. Now it was a plump thrush,
puffing out its speckled breast, and feasting
on the scarlet hips; now it was a blackbird,
with dusky plumage and yellow bill. Then
a score of finches and sparrows would alight
on the frozen snow, and quarrel over the
crumbs that she had scattered there. All day
the sky was grey and clear; but sometimes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
at sunset, a flush would rest upon the white
fields, tinting them with the delicate pink of
half-opened apple-blossoms.</p>

<p>On Christmas Eve, Rhoda Farren sat watching
the hungry birds no longer. A little
human life was drawing very near to immortality.
The baby&mdash;Helen’s wee, fragile baby&mdash;was
hovering between two worlds.</p>

<p>And then, for the first time, all Rhoda’s
sleeping instincts started up, awake and strong.
Anger and selfishness were alike forgotten.
Let the solemn feet of death be heard upon
the threshold of the house, and all the petty
wranglings of its inmates are stilled. He was
coming&mdash;“the angel with the amaranthine
wreath”&mdash;but Rhoda held the little one in
her arms, and prayed the Father to shut the
door against him.</p>

<p>We know not what we ask when we pray
for a child’s life. We are pleading with the
Good Shepherd that He will leave a little
lamb in the wilderness instead of taking it
into the fold. We are asking that it may<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
tread the long, toilsome way home, instead of
the short, smooth path that leads straight to
rest. Surely our Lord never loves us better
than when He says nay to such prayers as
these. When we become even as they&mdash;the
little children&mdash;and enter into the kingdom,
we shall understand the infinite compassion
of His denial.</p>

<p>Christmas night closed in; and outside the
cottage, the mummers, gay in patchwork and
ribbons, clashed their tin swords, and sang their
foolish rhymes. John went out and entreated
them to go away. A glance through the open
door showed Rhoda the clear, broad moonlight,
shining over the snow-waste, and she heard the
subdued voices of the men as they went off
to some happier house. Then the door closed
again, and she saw nothing but the little child’s
wan face.</p>

<p>“If it were taken,” she thought, “they should
all feel something as the shepherds did when
‘the angels were gone away from them into
heaven.’” Even she had begun to realize that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
a babe is indeed God’s angel in a household.
Often, like those Christmas angels, it stays
just long enough to be the messenger of peace
and good-will, and then returns to Him who
sent it. Like them, it leaves us without an
earth-stain on its vesture; without a regret for
the world from which it is so soon withdrawn.</p>

<p>But Helen’s little one was to remain. The
household rejoiced, and Rhoda learnt to recognise
herself in a new character. She became
the baby’s head-nurse and most devoted slave.</p>

<p>“Was there ever such a child?” she asked,
as it gained strength and beauty. “It will be
as pretty as Helen by-and-by.”</p>

<p>“It has a look of Robert,” said the farmer,
thoughtfully.</p>

<p>Rhoda’s smiles fled. She wanted to forget
the relationship between that man and her
darling. Nor was she without a fear that it
might have inherited some touch of his evil
nature. Her heart never softened towards him
because he was the father of the child. And<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
yet how much richer her life had grown since
she had taken the baby into it!</p>

<p>The snow lay long upon the ground. It was
so lengthened a winter, that spring seemed to
come suddenly. There was a burst of primroses
on the borders of the fields. They lit up
shady places with their pale yellow stars, and
spread themselves out in sheets. Every puff
of wind was sweet with the breath of violets;
birds sang their old carols&mdash;now two or three
clear notes&mdash;now a shake&mdash;then a long whistle.
All God’s works praised Him in the freshness
of their new life. Old dry stumps, that Rhoda
had thought dead and useless, began to put
forth green shoots. The earth teemed with
surprises; all around there was a continual
assertion of vitality. And so hard is it to
distinguish the barrenness of winter from the
barrenness of death, that every spring has its
seeming miracles. The tree that our impatient
hands had well-nigh hewn down may be our
sweetest shelter in the heat of summer noontide.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span></p>

<p>Not until the high winds had sent the blossoms
drifting over the orchards like a second
snowfall, did there come news of Helen’s husband.</p>

<p>The tidings came through Mr. Elton. Clarris
had written to him, enclosing a letter for his
wife. He had also sent notes to the amount
of forty pounds to his former employer. From
time to time he promised money should be
forwarded until the whole sum that he had
taken was restored.</p>

<p>“I believe,” wrote Mr. Elton to the farmer,
“that he will keep his word. He does not, he
declares, hope to wipe out his sin by this
restitution. ‘I am not one whit better than
any other criminal,’ he writes, ‘but I have been
more leniently dealt with than most of my
brethren. God’s mercy, acting through you,
has done much for me.’”</p>

<p>Helen did not show Rhoda the letter that
had been received. She was paler and sadder
after reading it, but she said nothing about its
contents. Rhoda took the child in her arms,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
leaving its mother sitting in silence, and went
out into the garden.</p>

<p>The wild winds had sunk to rest. A light
shower had fallen in the early morning, beating
out the sweetness of the new-born roses, and
the long, soft grass. The old walks glittered
and twinkled in the sunshine. The sky was
radiantly blue, and the clouds were fair.</p>

<p>“After all,” thought Rhoda, looking upward
with a sudden lifting of the spirit, “heaven is
full of forgiven sinners!”</p>

<p class="chapter_name">AN INVITATION FROM SQUIRE DERRICK.</p>

<p><span class = "smcap">As</span> the summer advanced, Helen’s spirits rose.
She was not the pale, plaintive woman that
Rhoda had found on her return from London.
Her beauty brightened visibly, and more than
one neighbour remarked that it was a sin and
a shame for such a pretty creature to be tied
up to a man who was nothing but a cross to
her.</p>

<p>Perhaps Helen herself was of the same
opinion. The baby was given up more and
more to Rhoda’s care, while its mother went
freely to the villagers’ houses. She was one of
those women to whom admiration is as necessary
as their daily food. Her pleasure in her
own loveliness amused while it saddened her
cousin. There was something in it that seemed
akin to the delight of a child in its fine clothes.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
Helen’s mind had never grown with her body.
But Rhoda and the others had got into the
habit of viewing her weaknesses indulgently.
And they gratified the little fancies that were,
as a rule, harmless enough.</p>

<p>They had their first disagreement at the end
of August. There was an early harvest that
year. In the southern counties most of the
wheat was cut and stacked before September
set in. The crops were plentiful, and there
was rejoicing on all sides. But it was not
always the right kind of rejoicing.</p>

<p>“It’s a strange way that some folks have
got of thanking the Lord of the harvest,”
remarked Farmer Farren one day. <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>“He gives
them bread enough to satisfy all their wants,
and they must needs show their gratitude by
stupefying themselves with beer! I used to
think, when I was a lad, that ’twas an odd
thing for King David to go a-dancing before
the Almighty with all his might. But there’s
more sense in dancing than in drinking for
joy.”</p>

<p>Father and daughter stood side by side,
leaning against the garden wall; for it was
evening, and the farmer’s work was done.
Just before he spoke, some drunken shouts
disturbed the quiet air. Labourers were roystering
in the village tavern, and many a wife’s
temper was sorely tried that night.</p>

<p>“O Uncle, I am glad you don’t think it’s
wrong to dance!” cried Helen, coming suddenly
out of the house. “Here’s good news!
Squire Derrick is going to give a feast in his
park next Friday. I know that John can’t go,
because of his sprained ankle; but William
Gill will drive us to the park in his <span lang = "fr" xml:lang = "fr">chaise</span>.
There’ll be room for Rhoda and me and Mrs.
Gill.”</p>

<p>“But, Helen, I don’t go to merry-makings,”
said Rhoda, gravely. <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>“We have never taken
part in anything of that kind. And as to
father’s remark, King David’s sort of dancing
was very different from the waltzes and polkas
and <span lang = "fr" xml:lang = "fr">galops</span> that there will be on Friday
night.”</p>

<p>Helen’s face clouded like that of a disappointed
child.</p>

<p>“O Uncle, would there be any harm in my
dancing?” she asked.</p>

<p>“No harm exactly, my girl,” responded the
farmer uneasily, as he picked a piece of dry
moss off the wall. “But even when things
are lawful, they are not always expedient.
You are a married woman, you see, and your
husband’s under a cloud, and miles away&mdash;poor
fellow!”</p>

<p>“Ah!” sighed Helen, “I’m always doomed
to suffer for his sins! I thought that perhaps
a little bit of fun would help me to forget
my troubles.”</p>

<p>Poor Helen was still grovelling at the foot
of her mountain.</p>

<p>Large tears stood in her soft eyes. The
farmer gave her a quick glance, then looked
away, and busied himself with the little
cushion of moss that still lay in his broad
palm. At heart he was more than half a
Puritan, and hated jigs and feastings as lustily<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
as did the Gideons and Grace-be-heres of
Cromwell’s day. But he was far too tender-natured
a man to bear the sight of a woman’s
tears.</p>

<p>But for that unfortunate allusion which her
father had made to Robert Clarris, Rhoda
would have set her face as a flint against
going to the <span lang = "fr" xml:lang = "fr">fête</span>. But his tone of pity
stirred up all her old resentment. Why was
this young wife, lovely and foolish, left without
her lawful protector? Had she not said
truly that she was doomed to suffer for his
sins? After all, it was scarcely her fault,
perhaps, that she was not elevated by her
trial. To “erect ourselves above ourselves”
is a bliss that we do not all reach. And it
is a bliss which bears such a close relationship
to pain, that one has no right to be
hard on a fellow-mortal who chooses the lower
ground.</p>

<p>Thoughts like these were passing through
Rhoda’s mind, while Helen still wept silently.
But it did not occur to Miss Farren that the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
truest kindness that can be done to another
is to raise him. She forgot that it is better
to stretch out a hand and say, “Friend, come
up higher,” than to step down to his level.
At that moment she thought only of pacifying
Helen. Of late her cousin had grown very
dear to her, partly, perhaps, for the sake of
her little child. Her whole soul recoiled from
the harvest-feast. She hated the clownish
merriment, and the dancing and drinking;
and yet, to please Helen, she was willing to
endure much that was distasteful.</p>

<p>“If you would promise not to dance,
Helen,” she began, hesitatingly. Her father
looked up in undisguised astonishment.</p>

<p>“Why, Rhoda,” he said, “I didn’t think
anything in the world would have made you
go!”</p>

<p>“O Rhoda, how good of you to give way!”
cried Helen, brightening. <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>“Of course I’ll
promise. It’s just like her, Uncle: she was
always the most unselfish girl on earth! She
doesn’t despise me because I’m weak-minded,
and like a little bit of pleasure. Ah, how
kind she is!”</p>

<p>The farmer said no more. He had a great
reverence for his daughter, and would not
take the matter out of her hands. But he
went indoors with a grave face; and Helen
followed him in a flutter of delight.</p>

<p>As Rhoda lingered that evening in the
dewy twilight, she began to charge herself
with cowardice. It would have been hard to
have held out against Helen’s desires. And
yet&mdash;for Helen’s own sake&mdash;ought she not to
have been firm? Most of us suffer if we
stifle our instincts; and hers had told her
that this feast was no place for her cousin.</p>

<p>“It shall be the last time that I am weak,”
she thought, hoping to atone for the present
by the future. “I will let her have her way
this once, and then I will set myself to guide
her in a better path.”</p>

<p>The grey, transparent veil of dusk stole
down, and the clear stars shone through it.
A little wind came creeping up the garden<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
like a human sigh. One or two white moths
flitted past, and a bird uttered a sleepy,
smothered note. For a minute she loitered
in the porch, listening to the pleasant, household
stir within. Helen’s laugh mingled
with John’s cheery tones and the clatter of
supper-plates.</p>

<p>“Where is Rhoda?” she heard her mother
say.</p>

<p>The jessamine, which grew all over the
porch, swung its slender sprays into her face.
The sweet, chill blossoms kissed her lips as
she passed beneath them; but she went
indoors with an unquiet mind.</p>

<p class="chapter_name">HELEN UNDER A NEW ASPECT.</p>

<p><span class = "smcap">On</span> Friday afternoon, Helen’s chamber-door
chanced to be left open, and Rhoda caught
a glimpse of a delicate silk dress lying on
the bed. She went straight into the room
and examined it. Bodice and sleeves were
trimmed profusely with costly lace; the rich
lilac folds might have stood alone, so thick
was the texture. It was not the sort of dress
that should have belonged to the wife of a
merchant’s clerk. Rhoda was perplexed.</p>

<p>“Isn’t it handsome!” asked Helen’s voice
behind her.</p>

<p>“I hope you are not thinking of wearing
it this evening,” said Rhoda. “It’s a most
unsuitable dress for a country merry-making.
Do put on something plainer, Helen.”</p>

<p>“O Rhoda,” she pleaded, <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>“I am not like
you; I can’t abide browns and greys! I want
to be dressed as the flowers are! You loved
the lilacs when they were in bloom; why
may I not copy them?”</p>

<p>“Their dress costs nothing,” said Rhoda,
“and the silk is a poor imitation of them.
Even Solomon in all his glory wasn’t arrayed
like the lilies of the field. This gown must
have been very expensive, Helen.”</p>

<p>“It is the best I have,” answered Helen,
flushing slightly. “I should like to give it
an airing, Rhoda. I own I am fond of fine
clothes, but you are so kind that you won’t
be angry with a poor silly thing like me!”</p>

<p>Again Rhoda’s strength was no match for
her cousin’s weakness. She went out of the
room without saying another word about the
lilac silk. An hour or two later William Gill’s
<span lang = "fr" xml:lang = "fr">chaise</span> stopped at the gate, and Helen came
downstairs. She was enveloped in a large
cloak which completely hid her dress from
the eyes of her uncle and aunt. Her face
was flushed; she was in high spirits. William<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
Gill&mdash;a prosperous young farmer&mdash;looked
sheepishly pleased as she seated herself by his
side.</p>

<p>Rhoda sat on the back seat with Mrs. Gill.
It was a still, sultry evening. The languor
of the waning summer seemed to have stolen
upon her unawares, and the good woman
found her a dull companion. Mrs. Gill was
proud of her son, proud of his fine horse, a
fiery young chestnut, proud of the <span lang = "fr" xml:lang = "fr">chaise</span>,
which had been newly painted and varnished.
But these subjects had little interest for Miss
Farren. And the worthy matron became convinced
that she was giving herself airs on the
strength of her annuity. By the time they had
reached the foot of Huntsdean hill, she was
as silent as Rhoda could desire.</p>

<p>The church clock was striking seven as
they turned in at the gates of Dykeley Park.
Groups of people were scattered about under
the trees. The hall door of Dykeley House
stood open, and the sound of music swept
forth into the evening air. Out of doors<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
there was the crimson of sunset staining the
skies, reddening the faces of the countryfolk,
and lighting up the west front of the old
mansion, till its red bricks seemed to burn
among the dark ivy and overblown white
roses. Quiet pools, lying here and there about
the park, glittered as if the old Cana miracle
had been wrought upon them, and their
waters were changed to wine. The colour
was too intense, too fiery. It made Rhoda
think of burning cities, or of the glare of
beacons, blazing up to warn the land that the
foe had crossed the border.</p>

<p>Squire Derrick’s old banqueting hall had
been cleared out for the dancers. The squire
himself, a bachelor of sixty, received his guests
as Sir Roger de Coverley might have done.
Rhoda saw his eyes rest on beautiful Helen
in the lilac silk, and his glance followed her
wonderingly as she went sweeping away to a
distant part of the great room. Other looks
followed her too.</p>

<p>Nor could Rhoda keep her own gaze from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
dwelling on her companion. When the long
cloak had been laid aside, and Helen appeared
in the lighted room, her cousin could hardly
restrain an exclamation. There were jewels
on her wrists and bosom, jewels on the white
fingers that flashed when she took off her
gloves to display them. A miserable sense of
shame and confusion overwhelmed Miss Farren.
Here was Helen bedizened like a Begum, and
here were many of the Huntsdean folk who
knew her husband’s story! The air seemed
full of whispers. Rhoda grew hot beneath
the broad stare of eyes. Yet few glanced at
her; the brown wren, reluctantly perched
beside the glittering peacock, was sheltered
from observation.</p>

<p>The musicians struck up a lively tune, and
then Rhoda saw that there were several gay
young officers in the room. They had come,
by the squire’s invitation, from the neighbouring
garrison town, and were evidently prepared
to enjoy themselves.</p>

<p>She was scarcely surprised to see two or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
three of them bearing down upon Helen, bent
on securing her for a partner. She heard
their entreaties, and Helen’s denials&mdash;very
prettily uttered. But at that moment an old
friend of Farmer Farren’s crossed the room,
and gave Rhoda a hearty greeting. Then
followed a score of questions about herself
and her parents, and in the midst of them
Rhoda heard Helen’s voice saying&mdash;</p>

<p>“Only one dance, Rhoda; you’ll forgive me,
I know.”</p>

<p>Rhoda started, and half rose from her seat.
Such a distressed and angry look crossed her
face that the old farmer was astonished.
Helen had gone off on her partner’s arm. It
was too late to call her back. She must take
it as quietly as she could, and avoid making
a scene.</p>

<p>“Who is that lovely young woman? Any
relation of yours, Miss Farren?” asked the old
man by her side.</p>

<p>“My cousin,” Rhoda answered.</p>

<p>Several persons near were listening for her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
reply. Rhoda hoped that her questioner would
drop the subject, but he did not.</p>

<p>“Let me see; didn’t I know her when she
was a child in your father’s house?”</p>

<p>“Very likely,” Rhoda said. “She used to
live with us when she was a little girl.”</p>

<p>“And did I hear that she had married?”
he persisted.</p>

<p>“She is married,” said Rhoda, desperately.
“Her husband is in Australia.”</p>

<p>Obtuse as he was, the old gentleman could
yet perceive that he had touched upon an
awkward topic. Poor Rhoda was a bad actress.
Her face always betrayed her feelings. She
sat bolt upright against the wall, looking so
intensely uncomfortable that her companion
quitted her in dismay.</p>

<p>There she remained for three long hours;
sometimes catching a glimpse of the lilac silk
among the dancers. From fragments of talk
that went on around her, she learned that
Helen was the centre of attention. And at last,
when a <span lang = "fr" xml:lang = "fr">galop</span> was over, and the groups parted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
to left and right, she caught sight of her cousin
surrounded by the officers.</p>

<p>She now saw Helen under a new aspect.
Her looks and gestures were those of a practised
coquette, who had spent half her life in
ball-rooms. People were looking on&mdash;smiling,
whispering, wondering. The squire himself was
evidently amused and astonished. Even if she
had been less beautiful, Helen’s dress and
jewellery would have attracted general notice.
It was, perhaps, the most miserable evening
that Rhoda had ever passed. “Am I my
brother’s keeper?” was the question that she
asked herself a hundred times. Was she indeed
to blame for suffering Helen to come to
this place? The music and dancing and flattering
speeches had fired Helen’s blood like
wine. The gaiety that would have been innocuous
to many was poisonous to her.</p>

<p>At last a loud gong sounded the summons
to supper. The repast was spread in a large
tent which had been erected in the park. Out
swept the crowd into the balmy August night,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
Helen still clinging to the arm of her last
partner, and carefully avoiding a glance in her
cousin’s direction. Rhoda strove in vain to get
nearer to her; the press was too great. But
she contrived to reach William Gill, and to say
to him earnestly&mdash;</p>

<p>“We must go away as soon as supper is over,
Mr. Gill. I promised father that we would come
back early.” The moon had risen, large and
red, and the night was perfectly still. Chinese
lanterns illuminated the great supper-tent from
end to end. Flowers and evergreens, mingled
with wheat ears, decorated the long tables.
The light fell on rows of flushed and smiling
faces. Rhoda, pale and sad, sat down on the
end of a bench close to the tent entrance.</p>

<p>“I’m ’most worn out,” said Mrs. Gill’s voice
beside her. <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>“I’m downright glad that you’re
for going home early, Miss Farren. Old women
like me are better a-bed than a-junketing at
this time o’ night! Mercy on us, how your
cousin <em>has</em> been a-going on, my dear! And
brought up so strict too!”</p>

<p>The words cut Rhoda like a knife. There
she sat, lonely and miserable, amid a merry
crowd. The golden moonshine flooded the
park, and the sweet air kissed her face as she
turned it wearily towards the tent-entrance.
Once a sudden rush of perfume came in and
overwhelmed her. It was the breath of the fast
fading roses that hung in white clusters about
the squire’s windows, and shed their petals on
the ground below.</p>

<p class = "chapter_name">“THE MASTER IS COME, AND CALLETH FOR
THEE.”</p>


<p><span class = "smcap">Rhoda</span> seized upon her cousin as she was
passing out of the tent. She was resolved that
Helen should not go back to the dancing-room.
What was done could not be undone. But she
would take her away before the crowd had
begun to disperse.</p>

<p>“Come, Helen,” she said, “I have your cloak
and hat; you needn’t go into the house again.
Mr. Gill will get the <span lang = "fr" xml:lang = "fr">chaise</span> ready at once.”</p>

<p>“O Rhoda, the fun is only just beginning,”
pleaded Helen. “And I have promised to
dance&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Then you must break the promise. It
won’t be the first that you have broken to-night,”
added Rhoda, sharply.</p>

<p>She wrapped Helen in her cloak, and tied her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
bonnet strings with her own hands. As they
stood there, in the strange mingling of lamplight
and moonlight, she could see that the
lovely face looked half-frightened and half-mutinous.
In an instant Rhoda repented of
her momentary harshness; somehow she had
never loved Helen better than she did at that
instant.</p>

<p>“I’m sorry to spoil your pleasure, darling,”
she whispered; “but what will the father say
if we are late?”</p>

<p>Helen’s brow cleared. Without a word she
walked straight to the place where the <span lang = "fr" xml:lang = "fr">chaise</span>
was standing, and climbed up into her seat.
William Gill, assisted by one of the squire’s
stable helpers, proceeded to harness the chestnut
horse, and in a few moments more they had
driven out of the park.</p>

<p>It was such a relief to Rhoda to be going
homewards, that for some moments she could
think of nothing else. The cool night air
soothed and refreshed her. The rattle of wheels
and the quick tramp of hoofs were the only<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
sounds that broke the silence. Cottages by the
wayside were dark and still. The firs that bordered
the road stood up rugged and black; not
a tree-top rocked, not a branch rustled. The
level highway was barred with deep shadows
here and there. Overhead there was a soft,
purple sky, and the moon hung like a globe of
gold above the faintly outlined hills.</p>

<p>As they drew near the end of the three-mile
drive, Rhoda’s troubled thoughts came flocking
back. All Huntsdean and Dykeley would be
talking of Helen Clarris to-morrow. Her dress,
her jewels, her levity, would give the tongues of
the gossips plenty of work for months to come.
The Farrens were a proud family in their way.
They were over-sensitive&mdash;as such people always
are&mdash;and hated to be talked about.
Rhoda knew that the village chatter could not
fail to reach her father’s ears, and she knew, too,
that it would vex him more than he would care
to say. As Mrs. Gill had said, Helen had been
strictly brought up. She had lived under her
uncle’s roof in her childhood, and had gone to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
school with her cousin. All that had been
done for Rhoda had been also done for her.</p>

<p>And then the jewels. Little as Miss Farren
knew of the worth of such things, she had felt
sure that they were of considerable value.
Moreover, they were new and fashionable, and
could not be mistaken for family heirlooms.
Had Robert Clarris purchased them in his
doting fondness for his wife? Were they love-gifts
made soon after their marriage? Anyhow,
Helen ought not to retain them. It was
plainly her duty to dispose of them, and send the
proceeds to Mr. Elton. Rhoda determined to
speak to her about this matter on the morrow.</p>

<p>Just as she had formed this resolution, they
turned out of the highway and entered the lane
leading to Huntsdean. The road dipped suddenly;
a sharp hill, overshadowed by trees, led
into the village.</p>

<p>“Nearly home,” said Mrs. Gill, rousing herself
from a doze. The words had hardly passed
her lips, when the chestnut horse started forward
with a mad bound. It might have been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
that William Gill’s brain was confused with the
squire’s strong ale. A buckle had been carelessly
fastened, and had given way. The
horse’s flanks were scourged and stung by the
flapping strap. There was a wild plunge into
the darkness of the lane, a terrible swaying
from side to side, and then a jerk and a crash
at the bottom of the hill.</p>

<p>For a few seconds Rhoda lay half stunned
upon the wet grass and bracken by the wayside.
She rose with a calmness that afterwards
seemed the strangest part of that night’s
history. Mrs. Gill was sitting on the sod
staring around her in a helpless way. The
other two, William and Helen, were stretched
motionless upon the stony road.</p>

<p>Still with that strange composure which never
lasts long, Rhoda ran to the nearest cottage.
Its windows were closed, and all was silent;
but she beat hard upon the door with her
clenched hands. A voice called to her from
within, but she never ceased knocking until a
labourer came forth.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span></p>

<p>“Hoskins,” she said, as the man confronted
her, “my cousin has been thrown out of Farmer
Gill’s <span lang = "fr" xml:lang = "fr">chaise</span>. You must come and carry her
home.”</p>

<p>The man came with her to the foot of the
hill, and lifted Helen in his strong arms.
Other help was forthcoming. The labourer’s
wife had roused her sons, and Mrs. Gill had
collected her scattered senses.</p>

<p>They were but a quarter of a mile from
home, but the distance seemed interminable
to Rhoda as she sped on to the house. The
familiar way appeared to lengthen as she ran;
and when at last her hand touched the latch
of the garden gate, her firmness suddenly
broke down. She tottered as she reached the
door, and then fell into John’s arms, crying
out that Helen was coming.</p>

<p>The farmer sat in his large arm-chair. The
Bible lay open on the table before him, for
he had been gathering the old strength and
sweetness from its pages. He had not
guessed that the strength would so soon be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
needed. But it was his way to lay up stores
for days of sorrow, and there was a look of
quiet power in his face that helped those
around him.</p>

<p>They carried Helen upstairs, and laid her
on her bed. The lilac silk was dusty and
blood-stained, the fragile lace soiled and torn.
With tender hands Rhoda unclasped her
glittering necklace and bracelets; the rings,
too, slipped easily from the slight fingers.
When those gay trinkets were out of sight,
Rhoda’s heart was more at ease. Helen was
their own Helen without them; the jewels
had done their best to make her like a
stranger. There was little to do then but to
wait until the doctor arrived.</p>

<p>As it will be with the day of the Lord, so
it often is with the day of trouble. It comes
“as a snare.” Frequently, like the stag in the
fable, we are looking for it in the very quarter
from which it never proceeds. It steals upon
us from another direction&mdash;suddenly, swiftly,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>“as a thief in the night.”</p>

<p>But the children of the kingdom are “not
in darkness, that that day should overtake
them as a thief.” They sleep, but their hearts
wake; and there is light in their dwellings.
Let the angels of death or of sorrow come
when they will, they are ready to meet them.
To the watchful and sober souls the Master’s
messengers are never messengers of wrath.
Ay, though they come with dark garments
and veiled faces, they bring some token of
Him who sends them. The garments “smell
of myrrh, aloes, and cassia;” the glory of
celestial love shines through the veil.</p>

<p>When Helen opened her eyes and looked
round upon them all, they knew that there
was death in her face. They knew it even
before the doctor arrived, and told them the
hard truth. She might linger a day or two
perhaps, just long enough for a leave-taking,
and then she must set forth on her lonely
journey. But how were they to tell her that
she must go?</p>

<p>“What did the doctor say?” she asked,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
faintly, after a long, long silence. The day
was breaking then, but they were still gathered
round her bed&mdash;still waiting and watching
with that new, calm patience that is born of
great sorrow.</p>

<p>“Nelly,” said the farmer, bending his head
down to hers, “‘The Master is come, and
calleth for thee.’ The call is sudden, my dear,
very sudden. But it’s the Master’s voice that
speaks.”</p>

<p>First there was a startled, distressed look,
but it passed away like a cloud. The brown
eyes were full of eager inquiry.</p>

<p>“Must it be?” she whispered. “Ah, I see
it must! Oh, I’m not ready&mdash;not nearly
ready. There’s so much to be forgiven; if
I could only know that He forgives me,
I wouldn’t want to stay.”</p>

<p>“Nelly!” answered the farmer in a clearer
tone, <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>“the Lord has got love and pardon for
all those who want it. It’s only from those
that don’t want it that He turns away. His
blood has washed out the sins of that great
multitude whom no man can number, and it
will cleanse you too. Do you think He ever
expects to find any of His children who don’t
need washing? Ay, the darker they are in
their own eyes, the fairer they seem in His!”</p>

<p>As Rhoda listened to her father’s words,
and to her cousin’s low replies, she began to
realize that poor, weak Helen had felt herself
to be a sinner for many a day. She had felt
it, and had tried to forget it. But this was
not the first time that she had heard the
Master’s call, and yearned to follow Him. Yet
the weakness of the flesh had prevailed again
and again, and her feet had gone on stumbling
on the dark mountains. They would never
stumble any more. The great King had come
Himself to guide them over the golden pavement
to the mansion prepared in His Father’s
house.</p>

<p>All that day Rhoda’s mother was by the
bedside. Rhoda herself went to and fro, now
ministering to the baby’s wants, now hanging
over her cousin’s pillow. Once she stayed out<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
of the room for nearly half-an-hour, and on
entering it again, she saw her mother strangely
agitated. Helen’s head was on her aunt’s
bosom, and her pale lips were moving. But
Rhoda could not hear what she said.</p>

</div>

<p>She tarried with them until the breaking
of another day. The sun came up. Shadows
of jessamine sprays were drawn sharply on the
white blind; a glory of golden light fell on
the chamber wall. Towards that light the
dying face was turned. To Rhoda, at that
moment, came a sudden impulse. Clearly and
firmly she repeated the familiar lines that she
and Helen had learnt years ago,&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
  <div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">“The wide arms of Mercy are spread to enfold thee,</div>
<div class="verse indent2">And sinners may hope, for the Sinless has died.”</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>For answer, there was a quick, bright smile,
and then the half-breathed word&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
  <div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
<div class ="verse">“Forgiven.”</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Only an hour later, Rhoda was walking
along the grassy garden-path with Helen’s
child in her arms. Was it yesterday that they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
were children playing together? Had ten
years or sixty minutes gone by since she
died? If she had come suddenly out of the
old summer-house among the beeches&mdash;a gay,
smiling girl&mdash;Rhoda could scarcely have wondered.
There are moments in life when we
put time away from us altogether.</p>

<p>And yet one had to come back to the
everyday world again&mdash;a very fair world on
that morning. Newly-reaped fields lay bare
and glistening in the sun; thistle-down drifted
about in the languid air, and the baby stretched
out her hands to grasp the butterflies. She
looked up, wonderingly, with Helen’s brown
eyes, when Rhoda pressed her to her bosom
and wept.</p>

<p class = "chapter_name">DISPOSING OF HELEN’S JEWELS.</p>


<p><span class = "smcap">A month</span> went by. The household fell back
into its old ways. The little child laughed
and played, and grew dearer and dearer to
them all.</p>

<p>Mrs. Farren had taken upon herself the
task of looking over Helen’s things. She
performed this duty without any aid from
Rhoda; and not one word did she say about
the jewels. The farmer had written to Australia,
breaking the sad news to Robert Clarris
as gently as he could. How would he receive
it? Rhoda wondered. They had left off speaking
of him in her hearing. They were aware
of all the bitter dislike that she cherished, but
they never sought to soften her heart. They
were content&mdash;as the wisest people are&mdash;to
leave most things to time. We do not know<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
how often we wrong a friend by hotly defending
him, nor how we help an enemy by running
him down.</p>

<p>Now that Helen was gone, Rhoda was
harassed by a new fear. She dreaded lest
Robert should take away the child.</p>

<p>It was more than probable that he would
marry again one day. A hard-natured, selfish
man&mdash;such as she believed him to be&mdash;would
need a wife to slave for him. Then he
would send for Rhoda’s ewe lamb, and there
would be an end to her dream of future
happiness. She did not realize that God seldom
makes us happy in our own way. Blessings,
like crosses, nearly always come from
unexpected quarters. We search for honey in
an empty hive, and find it at last in the carcase
of a dead lion.</p>

<p>The Gills, mother and son, were little the
worse for that night’s catastrophe. Like all
tragedies, Helen’s death was a nine days’
wonder. There was plenty of sympathy;
there were condolences from all sides. And<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
then the excitement died out; the small topics
of daily life resumed their old importance.
And so the time went on.</p>

<p>At the end of October, the farmer received
a reply to his letter. Rhoda refrained from
asking any questions, and they did not tell her
how the widower had borne the blow. She
saw tears in her mother’s eyes, and thought
that a great deal of love and pity are wasted
in the world. Long afterwards, her opinion
changed, and she understood that money is
often wasted&mdash;love and pity never. Thank
God, it is only the things that “perish in the
using” which we ever can waste!</p>

<p>On the very day after the Australian letter
came, the black mare was put into the light
cart. The farmer dressed himself in his best
clothes, and carefully examined the harness.
These were signs that he was going to drive
to the town.</p>

<p>“Maybe it would do you no harm to come,
Rhoda,” he said, suddenly. <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>“Put on your
bonnet, and bring the little one.”</p>

<p>Rhoda ran up into her room, and dressed
herself in haste. Little Nelly crowed with
glee when her small black <span lang = "fr" xml:lang = "fr">pelisse</span> was buttoned
on. She was quite unconscious of the
compassion that her mourning garments excited.
And even when she was fairly seated
in the cart, her shrill cries of delight brought
a smile into the farmer’s grave face.</p>

<p>It was one of the last, peaceful autumn
days. The early morning sky had been
covered with a grey curtain, whose golden
fringes swept the hills from east to west. As
the sun rose higher, the clouds were lifted, the
bright fringes broadened, and there was light
upon all the land.</p>

<p>Rhoda and her father did not talk much.
Her instincts told her that he was disposed
to be silent; and there was a great deal to
occupy eyes and mind. The bindweed hung
its large white flowers across the yellow hedges.
The wild honeysuckle, in its second bloom,
was like an old friend who comes back to
comfort us in our declining fortunes. They<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
reached at length the brow of the great chalk
hill that overlooks the harbour. There lay the
sea&mdash;a waste of soft blue-grey, touched with
gleams of gold and dashes of silver. There,
too, lay the Isle of Wight in the tranquil sunshine.
The mare trotted on, down hill all the
way, till they entered the noisy streets of the
busy seaport, and left peace and poetry behind.</p>

<p>The farmer stopped at last before a silversmith’s
shop. He put the reins into Rhoda’s
hand, took a little wooden box from under
his seat, and descended from the cart. For a
few seconds his daughter was utterly bewildered.
The stock of family plate was limited
to a cream-jug and spoons. And even if they
had made up their minds to part with those
treasures, the proceeds would hardly have recompensed
them for the sacrifice. Yet what
could be the contents of the wooden box that
her father had carried into the shop? The
truth flashed upon Rhoda. He was disposing
of Helen’s jewels. He had obtained her husband’s
permission to sell them.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span></p>

<p>He came out again with a sober face. The
silversmith came too, rubbing his hands as if
he were not ill satisfied with his bargain. He
wished the farmer good day, and the mare
jogged steadily back to Huntsdean.</p>

<p>But Rhoda learnt, long afterwards, that the
money for which the jewels were sold did not
go to Mr. Elton. It went towards the maintenance
of Helen’s child.</p>

<p class = "chapter_name">THE FARM PURCHASED BY ONE RALPH

<p><span class = "smcap">Eight</span> years passed away. In Huntsdean
churchyard the grass had grown over Helen’s
grave, covering up the bare, brown earth, as
new interests cover an old sorrow.</p>

<p>Little Nelly had never realized her loss. It
contented her to know that her mother had
been laid to rest in a sweet place, and would
rise again some day when the Lord called her.
She always hoped that Helen might rise in
the spring, and find the primroses blooming
round her pretty grave. She might have
fancied that, like Keats, her mother could
“feel the flowers growing over her.” Children
and poets often have the same fancies.</p>

<p>November had come again; and with it
came a new anxiety.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span></p>

<p>The small farm, rented by Farmer Farren,
had passed into new hands. Squire Derrick
was dead, and “another king arose, who knew
not Joseph.” The heir was a needy, grasping
man. Old tenants were nothing to him, and
he was in want of ready money.</p>

<p>He had made up his mind to sell the little
farm. It was more than likely, therefore, that
the Farrens would be turned out of the old
nest. For the young, it is easy to build new
homes, and gather new associations around
them; but for the old, it is well-nigh impossible.
Their very lives are built into the
ancient walls. When they leave a familiar
dwelling, they long to go straight to “a
house not made with hands, eternal in the
heavens.”</p>

<p>John was now bailiff to a rich landowner in
Sussex. He had a wife and child; but he
was not unmindful of other ties. “Come to
me,” he wrote, “if you are turned out of the
old place.” But the parents sighed and shook
their heads. They had not greatly prospered<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
in Huntsdean, yet no other spot on earth could
be so dear to them.</p>

<p>“Whatever the Lord means me to do, I’ll
strive to do it willingly,” said the farmer,
bravely. “Oftentimes I’m mighty vexed with
myself for clinging so hard to these old bricks
and mortar, and those few fields yonder. If
I leave them, I shan’t leave my Lord behind
me; and if I stay with them, He’ll soon be
calling me away. But you see, an old man
has his whims; and I wanted to step out
of this old cottage into my Father’s house.”</p>

<p>In this time of uncertainty, a new duty
suddenly called Rhoda from home. Her
father’s only sister&mdash;a childless widow&mdash;lay
dying in Norfolk, and sent for her niece to
come and nurse her.</p>

<p>It was decided that she must go. Her aunt
had no other relatives, and could not be left
alone in her need. But it was with a heavy
heart that Rhoda said farewell to the three
whom she loved best on earth, and set out
on her long, solitary journey.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span></p>

<p>It was a keen, clear morning when she
went away. A brisk wind was blowing; the
brown leaves fled before it, as the hosts of
the Amorites before the sword of Joshua. In
dire confusion they hurried along over soft
turf and stony ground. It was a day on
which all things seemed to be astir. Crows
were cawing, and flying from tree to tree;
magpies flashed across the road; flocks of
small birds assembled on the sear hedges.
And far off could be heard the clamour of
foxhounds and shouts of the huntsmen.</p>

<p>Rhoda wondered, with a pang, how it
would be when she came back. Do we ever
leave any beloved place without fearing that
a change may fall upon it in our absence?
It is at such times as these that the heart
loves to rest itself upon the Immutable.
“Lord, Thou hast been our dwelling-place
from all generations.” “Thou art the same,
and Thy years shall not fail.”</p>

<p>It was a weary sojourn in Norfolk. The
widow’s illness was long and trying. But<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
God has a way of making hard work seem
easy; and He lightened Rhoda’s labour with
good news from home.</p>

<p>Two months passed by, and her aunt still
hovered between life and death. Mrs. Farren’s
letters had not given any definite reason for
hope; and yet hopefulness pervaded every line,
and clung to every sentence like a sweet perfume.
Rhoda felt its influence and rejoiced.
And at last, when January came to an end,
the mother spoke out plainly.</p>

<p>The farm was purchased by one Ralph
Channell. He was a prosperous man who had
come from Australia, and had been settled in
England about a year. He was quite alone
in the world, and had proposed to take up his
abode with the Farrens in the old cottage.
The farmer was to manage everything as usual.
No change would be made in any of their
household ways. Mr. Channell had been
acquainted with Robert Clarris in Australia,
and it was through Clarris that he had first
heard of the Farrens. What he asked of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
them was a home. They might have the old
house rent-free, if they would let him live in
it with them.</p>

<p>Thus, a heavy burden was lifted from
Rhoda’s heart. Mrs. Farren’s letter was a
psalm of thanksgiving from beginning to end.
“In the day when I cried, Thou answeredst
me, and strengthenedst me with strength in
my soul,” she wrote, in her gladness. And
Rhoda’s spirit caught up the joyful strain.
Yet she once found herself wishing that Mr.
Channell had not been one of Robert Clarris’s
friends. True, Clarris had long ago restored
the three hundred pounds, and had regularly
sent money for his child’s support. But was
not the old taint upon him still?</p>

<p>Rhoda could never get rid of the notion
that he had been too leniently dealt with.
Hers was a mind which always clings to an
idea. Moreover, her life, from its very beginning,
had been a narrow life. She had never
been called upon to battle with a strong temptation.
But, like all whose strength has not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
been tried, she believed that she could have
stood any test. It is easy for him who sits in
peace to cry shame on the soldier who deserts
his post. There are few of us who cannot
be heroes in imagination. And most of our
harsh judgments come from a narrow experience.</p>

<p>We can only learn something of the power
of Divine Love by knowing the evil against
which it contends. Those who want to see
what God’s grace can do must look for its
light in dark places.</p>

<p>When February and March had gone by,
Rhoda found herself free to go home. She
went back to the sweet lights and shadows
of April; to the glitter of fresh showers, and
the scent of hyacinths and wall-flowers. Her
mother’s arms were opened to her. Nelly
clung to her neck, half-crying for joy. Her
father and Mr. Channell were out in the
meadows, they told her; they would come
indoors for tea. It was Nelly who had most
to say about the stranger.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span></p>

<p>“You never knew anybody so kind, Rhoda,”
she said, earnestly. “He makes us all happy,
and he’s taken me to see mother’s grave every
Sunday while you were away.”</p>

<p>Rhoda was standing at the back-door when
she saw them coming from the fields. Nelly,
with her pinafore full of kittens, still chattered
by her side. Just in front of the door was
the old cherry-tree, covered with silvery blossoms
and spangled with rain-drops. It looked
like a bridal bouquet hung with diamonds.
Men were sowing barley in the acres beyond
the fence. Rhoda was watching the blossoms
and the sowers, and yet she saw those two
figures.</p>

<p>The first glance told her that Mr. Channell
was a strong man. In his younger days he
might have been almost handsome, but he
was one of those men who had lost youth
early in life. It was a face with which sorrow
had been very busy, and hard work had put
the finishing touches to the lines that sorrow
had begun. Rhoda did not know what it was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
in this man that made her think of Luther.
But when she looked at him she saw the same
kind of peace that the reformer’s features might
have worn. It may be that there is a family
likeness among all God’s Greathearts. For
all those who have fought the good fight must
show “the seal of the living God” on their
foreheads as well as the scars of the conflict.
Even our dim eyes may see the difference
between the marks that are got in the devil’s
service and those that have been won in the
battles of the Lord.</p>

<p>From that very day there was a change in
Rhoda’s life. Some of us, in looking back on
our lives, can remember the exact spot where
the old straight road took a turn at last. It
had run on so long in the same even line, that
we thought there would never be any change
at all. Other roads had always been crooked&mdash;full
of twists and ups and downs; ours never
varied. But at last, when it looked straightest
and smoothest, the turn came.</p>

<p>Rhoda began to think that the world was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
widening, as we all do when an expanding
process is going on within ourselves.</p>

<p>First she found out that the old cottage
was a much pleasanter place than it used to
be, and that the parents seemed growing
younger instead of older. Mr. Channell discovered
all their little likings and dislikings
and carefully studied them. Some folks think
they have done wonders if they scatter flowers
in a friend’s path, but Ralph Channell’s work
was the quiet removal of the thorns. Perhaps
the best labourers in the world are those who
have striven to undo evil rather than to do
good, but they are not those who have had
the most praise.</p>

<p>He had brought a goodly number of books
to Huntsdean, but Rhoda learnt more from
the life-histories that he told her than from
the printed volumes. They helped her to read
the books by a new light.</p>

<p>In his way&mdash;and it was a very unassuming
way&mdash;he had been doing missionary work in
Melbourne. And in listening to him Rhoda<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
first understood how Christ’s love follows the
sinner, and hunts him into the darkest corners
of the earth rather than lose him. In this
universe, where wheat and tares grow together,
and angels and devils strive together, mercy
never rests. For the prince of darkness is not
so active as He who hath said, “Lo, I am with
you always, even unto the end of the world.”
If the devil “goeth about as a roaring lion,
seeking those whom he may devour,” the Good
Shepherd is seeking, too, to save them that are
lost. There is only one power stronger than
hate, and that is love.</p>

<p>In this strain did Mr. Channell talk to
Rhoda. The spring passed away, summer days
came and went, and still no mention had ever
been made by either of them of Robert Clarris.
At last, however, his name was brought up
abruptly by Rhoda herself.</p>

<p><span class = "smcap">On</span> a Sunday afternoon these two, Ralph and
Rhoda, had strayed out into the old orchard
at the back of the house. The summer world
was just then in all its glory. The meadows
looked as if a flowery robe had been shaken
out over them; the orchard grass was full of
tall, shiny buttercups and large field-daisies,
resplendent in their snowy frills. A turquoise
sky smiled down through the leaf-laden boughs
above their heads; bees were murmuring all
around them.</p>

<p>“Mr. Channell,” asked Rhoda, suddenly,
“you know Nelly’s father, don’t you?”</p>

<p>He stooped and gathered one of the large
daisies. For a moment there was no reply.
The bees filled up the pause while she waited
for his answer.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span></p>

<p>“Yes,” he said at last, “I know him well.”</p>

<p>“Is he really penitent?” she inquired, doubtfully.
“Does he think that what he has done
has blotted out the past? It’s easy to whitewash
a dirty wall, but the stains are underneath
the whitewash still.”</p>

<p>“There is a vast difference between the
stain which is only whitewashed over, and
that which Christ’s blood has blotted out,”
replied Mr. Channell. “I don’t believe that
Robert Clarris can ever forget the past, or
think that he has atoned for it. But he knows
that the Lord has put away his sin.”</p>

<p>“How does he know it?” Rhoda demanded.</p>

<p>“Until he had committed that great crime,”
Ralph went on, <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>“he knew nothing at all of
the love of Christ. He had been a moral
man, satisfied with his morality. Then came
secret sorrows&mdash;then much worldly perplexity,
followed by a strong temptation&mdash;and he fell.
And when he lay grovelling in the dust, the
Lord’s voice travelled to him along the ground.
While he had walked erect, he had never
heard it.”</p>

<p>“Wasn’t Mr. Elton over-merciful to him?”
asked Rhoda. “I have often thought so.”</p>

<p>A sudden light seemed to kindle in Ralph’s
eyes.</p>

<p>“There are many,” he said, “who pray
Sunday after Sunday that the Lord will
raise up them that fall, and yet do all they
can to keep the fallen ones down. Mr. Elton
was not one of those. He thought that if half
the blows that were spent upon sinners were
bestowed upon Satan, the Evil One would
indeed be beaten down under our feet. God
bless him! He saved a sinner from the consequences
of one dark hour!”</p>

<p>Again there was a pause. This time it was
broken by little Nelly, who came bounding
in between them. Ralph bent down and
clasped the child closely in his arms.</p>

<p>“Oh, my darling,” he said, as he held her,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>“may the Lord make you one of His handmaidens!
May He send you forth to raise
up them that fall, and to bind up the broken
in heart!”</p>

<p>Perhaps it was not the first time that Nelly
had heard this prayer. It did not surprise
her as it did Rhoda. Miss Farren watched
Ralph’s face earnestly, till it had regained its
usual look of peace.</p>

<p>“Mr. Channell,” she began, yielding to a
sudden impulse, “I’m sure you must have
suffered a great deal. Forgive me for saying
so much,” she added, “but I’ve sometimes
thought that you have the look of a victor.”</p>

<p>He turned towards the house, holding
Nelly’s hand in his.</p>

<p>“I must answer you in another’s words,”
he replied. “They are better than any of
mine. ‘To me also was given, if not victory,
yet the consciousness of battle, and the
resolve to persevere therein while life or
faculty is left.’”</p>

<p>“The consciousness of battle,” Rhoda repeated
to herself. <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>“Perhaps that was what
St. Paul felt when he found a law in his
members warring against the law in his mind.
And perhaps it’s a bad thing to be conscious
of no warfare at all.”</p>

<p>And then she began to wonder if she were
anything like Robert Clarris before he fell.
Had she ever really heard the Lord’s voice?
Were not her ears deafened by the clamour
of self-conceit? Alas, it goes ill with us when
we mistake the voice of self-congratulation
for the voice of God!</p>

<p>But there came a time when Rhoda reached
the very bottom of the Valley of Humiliation.
She grew conscious that she, a strong,
self-reliant woman, had silently given a love
that had never been asked of her. When a
man takes a woman by the hand, and lifts
her above her old self, it is ten to one that
she falls in love with him.</p>

<p>We all know what it is to wonder at the
change that love makes in a woman. We
have marvelled often what that clever man
could have seen in this commonplace girl, but
we admit that he has made her a new<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
creature. Perhaps, like the great sculptor, he
attacked the marble block with Divine fervour,
believing that an angel was imprisoned
in it. And his instincts were not wrong after
all. The shapeless stone was chipped away
and the beautiful form revealed.</p>

<p>But Rhoda had no reason to think that
Ralph Channell cared for her more than for
others. In every respect he was above her.
The rector (rectors are great persons in country
villages) had found out that Mr. Channell
was a thoughtful and cultivated man. The
rector’s family said that he was charming,
and they wondered why he shut himself up
with the Farrens in their dull cottage.
Nobody ever intimated that he was thinking
of Rhoda. All the country people had
settled that she was to be an old maid.
She was too good for the farmers, and not
good enough for the squires’ sons. And for
many a year Rhoda had been very comfortably
resigned to her fate.</p>

<p>Bit by bit, however, she had let her heart<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
go, and she awoke one day, suddenly and
miserably, to the knowledge that she had
parted with the best part of herself. There
is no need to tell how or when she made
the discovery. A chance word, a trivial incident,
may send us to look into the casket
where we kept our treasure, and we find it
empty.</p>

<p class = "chapter_name">THE STORY OF THE ONE DARK HOUR.</p>

<p><span class = "smcap">Rhoda</span> tried hard to conceal her loss. Now
that the treasure was gone, she double-locked
the casket. No one, she resolved, should
know how poor she was. So well did she
play her part, that those around thought her
sterner and harder&mdash;that was all.</p>

<p>Her manner to Ralph changed visibly.
She began to avoid his company; their
familiar conversations were at an end. Her
whole energy was now devoted to one endeavour&mdash;to
keep him in ignorance of that
which he had won. If she were poor, he
should be none the richer. And thus, poor
soul, she went about her daily duties, putting
on a hard face to hide her weakness. Even
Nelly found that Rhoda was not so pleasant
as she used to be, and the child turned<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
more and more to Mr. Channell. Was he
gaining her too?</p>

<p>“I am losing everything, and he is getting
everything,” said Rhoda, to herself. “Perhaps
this is God’s way of showing me how
small my strength is. Haven’t I lost the
very thing that I thought myself best able
to keep?”</p>

<p>It will always be so with those whom the
Lord teaches. In one way or another the
humbling process must be gone through.
Sometimes it is seen of all men; sometimes
it is known to Him alone. But as certainly
as He loves us “shall the nail that is fastened
in the sure place be removed, and be cut
down and fall; and the burden that was
upon it shall be cut off, for the Lord hath
spoken it.” In the soul that He makes his
own He will not leave a single peg to hang
self-confidence upon. And when our chamber
walls are bare, and the tawdry rags of
self-esteem are swept out, He will enter and
fill the room with sweetness.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span></p>

<p>One afternoon, in the golden harvest-time,
Rhoda and Nelly sauntered up into the wheat-fields.
The reapers were resting under the
hedges; in the largest field nearly all the corn
had been gathered into sheaves. Rhoda tired
quickly now; for when the heart is heavy, the
limbs are apt to be weary. She stopped in
the middle of the field and dropped down to
rest, leaning her back against a great russet
shock. A few stray ears nodded overhead,
and Nelly nestled under their shadow.</p>

<p>She had always been an impulsive child,
one of those children who will ask any question
that comes into their heads, and a good
many come. She had no notion of restraining
her curiosity. If anything puzzled her, she
must always have it explained.</p>

<p>“Rhoda,” she said, suddenly, in her clear
little voice, “what has Mr. Channell done to
offend you? Don’t you like him?”</p>

<p>The words struck Rhoda like a sharp unexpected
blow. Without a moment’s pause
she cried out harshly and bitterly&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span></p>

<p>“I wish he’d never come here, Nelly; I
wish you and I had never seen him!”</p>

<p>Nelly was so startled by the passionate tone
that she jumped up from her seat. As she
moved, somebody on the other side of the
shock moved also. It was Mr. Channell.
Rhoda turned her head in time to see him
walking away. In an instant she realized that
he had heard all, but she dared not think of
the construction that would be put upon her
outburst. Perhaps she had mortally offended
her father’s best friend; perhaps he would go
away from them all for ever.</p>

<p>“Oh, what a wretched woman I am!” she
groaned, aloud. And then she saw that Nelly
had run off after Ralph Channell.</p>

<p>She rose slowly, and wandered back again
to the cottage. The doors and windows were
set wide open. Her mother sat peacefully
knitting in the parlour, but Rhoda went
straight upstairs to her own room. Nobody
could do her any good just then. She wanted
to be alone and get her senses together. Her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
head ached, and she had a dazed, helpless
feeling of having cut herself off from everything
comforting. So she sat down for a few
minutes by the bedside, then got up, and fell
suddenly on her knees.</p>

<p>In her prayer she did not get much beyond
telling God that she was miserable. It was
rather an outpouring of sorrow than a plea
for help. But it was her first heartfelt confession
of utter weakness, and perhaps that
was the best way of asking for strength. The
stray sheep that falls helpless at the Shepherd’s
feet is sure to be folded in His arms and carried
in His bosom.</p>

<p>She could not go down and sit at the tea-table
as usual, and no one came to disturb
her in her solitude. But at last, when the
shadows were lengthening over the fields, and
the distant church-clock struck six, she heard
a footstep on the stairs. The door opened
softly, and her mother’s face looked in.</p>

<p>“May I come to you, Rhoda?” she asked,
gently.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span></p>

<p>“Yes, mother,” Rhoda answered. “I know
how shocked and hurt you must be,” she
added. “But, indeed, I couldn’t help it.”</p>

<p>“O Rhoda,” said Mrs. Farren, “we’ve all
thought you seemed stern and strange lately,
but we didn’t know until to-day that you had
found out our secret. <em>He</em> says that it has
been all wrong from the beginning; he thinks
you ought to have heard the truth at once.”</p>

<p>“The truth, mother?” echoed Rhoda.
“What is it that you mean?”</p>

<p>“He says, dear Rhoda, that he ought to
have told you who he was,” Mrs. Farren
replied. “He sees now that it was wrong to
come here under a new name.”</p>

<p>“A new name!” her daughter repeated.
“For pity’s sake, mother, speak plainly. Who
is he, if he is not Ralph Channell?”</p>

<p>“We all thought you must have found out,”
said Mrs. Farren, in a perplexed tone. “He
is poor Helen’s husband&mdash;Robert Clarris.”</p>

<p>It was not until some minutes had passed
away that Rhoda was calm enough to hear<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>
her mother’s story. The two sat hand in
hand, nearer to each other in heart than they
had ever been before. Perhaps Mrs. Farren
had always been a little afraid of her daughter;
but now that she had got a glimpse into
Rhoda’s inner self the reserve vanished.</p>

<p>“We had always felt sure that Robert was
no practised sinner,” she began; “but we
did not know what it was that had driven
him to a crime&mdash;we only guessed something
like the truth. O Rhoda, it’s an awful
thing when vanity gets the upper hand with
a woman! Poor Helen made a sad confession
to me when she lay dying in this very
room. It’s hard to speak of the faults of the
dead; but there’s justice to be done to the
living.”</p>

<p>“Whatever her faults may have been, they
were no worse than mine,” Rhoda said, humbly;
“and she has done with sinning now, while
I shall be going on&mdash;perhaps for years longer.”</p>

<p>“Helen got deeply into debt,” Mrs. Farren
continued; <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>“and she used, I am afraid, to go
to balls and theatres without her husband’s
knowledge. He was sent away sometimes on
business by Mr. Elton. But don’t think her
worse than she was, Rhoda&mdash;she loved gaiety
and admiration passionately, but she wasn’t
a bad woman at heart&mdash;he always knew and
believed that; yet she got him into terrible
difficulties, poor child! And at last, when
her debts had amounted to three hundred
pounds, she flung herself at his feet and confessed
the truth.”</p>

<p>Both the women were crying. It was indeed
hard to expose the faults and follies of the
dead. They felt as if they had been tearing
the soft turf and sweet flowers from Helen’s
grave; and yet it had to be done.</p>

<p>“Robert was not a converted man at that
time,” went on Mrs. Farren. <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>“The blow
knocked him down, and utterly bewildered
him. He saw no means at all of paying the
debts, and he knew they must be paid immediately.
Helen hadn’t confessed till her
creditors had driven her to extremities; and
he went into the city in a state of despair,
for there was ‘no help for him in his God.’
Perhaps he would have asked aid from his
employer if Mr. Elton had been the owner of
the business. But old Mrs. Elton was a close
woman, and her son did nothing without her
consent.”</p>

<p>Rhoda could almost guess what was coming.
She could see now that man’s extremity is
often the devil’s opportunity. If a soul does
not seek help from God, the prince of darkness
steps in.</p>

<p>“On that very morning,” said Mrs. Farren,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>“he found a note from Mr. Elton waiting for
him in the office. His master told him that
he had been suddenly called off to Ireland to
look after some property there. He should
be absent six weeks&mdash;perhaps longer. Clarris
was to take his place and manage things, as
he always did while Mr. Elton was away.
And just an hour or two later a sunburnt,
sailor-like man came in, and clapped Robert
on the shoulder. Robert, poor fellow, didn’t
recollect him at first; but when he said that
he was Frank Ridley, and that he had come
to pay a debt of long standing, he remembered
all about him.”</p>

<p>“Oh! mother, why did he come just then?”
sighed Rhoda.</p>

<p>“The Lord suffered it to be so,” Mrs. Farren
answered. “Christ’s hour was not yet come.
That was the devil’s hour, and a dark hour
it was.”</p>

<p>She went on with the story in her own
straightforward way. Frank Ridley and Mr.
Elton had been schoolfellows and dear friends.
But while Elton was steady and painstaking,
even in boyhood, Frank was a never-do-well.
One chance after another slipped through his
fingers; situations were got and lost. At last
some new opening offered itself; but money
was needed, and Frank was at that time
almost penniless. He came to Elton in his
strait, and asked for the loan of three hundred
pounds.</p>

<p>To everybody’s surprise, Mrs. Elton lent<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
him the sum. She had a liking for handsome
young Ridley, and opened her purse with a
good grace for his sake. But Frank’s undertaking
was, as usual, a dead failure, and the
money was hopelessly lost. Ridley himself
was lost too. For eight years he was neither
seen nor heard of; and then he turned up
again in Elton’s office with a pocket-book
stuffed with bank-notes.</p>

<p>“I’ve found out my vocation at last,” he
shouted, in his hearty tones. “I’m captain
of a trading vessel, and I’ve traded on my
own account to good purpose. Here’s the
three hundred, and I’m downright sorry that
I must be off again without seeing your
governor, Clarris.”</p>

<p>Robert received the money&mdash;all in notes&mdash;and
gave a receipt; and then the sailor went
his way. After that the enemy came in like
a flood, and the deep waters rushed over
Robert’s soul. He did not cry, “Lord, save,
or I perish!” Alas! he thought of everything
rather than of Him who is able to save<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
to the uttermost. Here was the exact sum
that was needed. Frank Ridley was off on
his voyages again, and would never, perhaps,
return. Robert had only to put the notes in
his pocket, and make no entry in the ledger.
Of course there was a certain risk in doing
this; but it was very unlikely that anything
would be found out. And here was the sum&mdash;the
very sum that was wanted&mdash;within his
grasp. He would pay it all back; he would
work night and day to do that. He caught
at that honest resolution, and clung to it as
a man clings to a frail spar when the ship
goes to pieces.</p>

<p>This was Apollyon’s hour of triumph.
Robert went out and paid Helen’s bills on
that very night. But the burden that he had
taken up was far heavier than that which he
had thrown off. It was on a Monday morning
that he had received Ridley’s money;
and the succeeding days dragged on as if
each day were weighted with iron fetters, till
Saturday came. Robert wrote to his master<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
daily, entering into all the details of business
as minutely as usual. Then on the Sunday
morning&mdash;that last Sunday that he ever spent
with Helen&mdash;he went upstairs after breakfast,
and laid down upon his bed. The sense of
sin and shame was upon him; he would not
mock God by going to church and looking
like a respectable man. His wife did not
know what ailed him. He had told her that
the debts were paid&mdash;that was all.</p>

<p>Monday came again, the anniversary of his
sin. And there, on the office-desk, lay a letter
addressed to himself in his master’s handwriting.
It had been written on Saturday,
and was dated from Dublin.</p>

<p>“I find I am at liberty to come home at
once,” Mr. Elton wrote. <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>“I have found a
friend here who will look after the property
for me. Strangely enough, I ran against
Frank Ridley yesterday, and could scarcely
believe my own eyes. He had come to Dublin
in quest of an old sweetheart. He told me
that he had called at the office, and had paid
his old debt. He showed me your receipt
when I looked incredulous. I am rather surprised
that you did not mention this in your
letters.”</p>

<p>Robert Clarris put on his hat and coat
and went quietly into the outer office.</p>

<p>“Blake,” he said, calling the eldest of the
under clerks, “I am not well, and must go
home at once. I leave the keys in your
charge, for I know you may be trusted.”</p>

<p>Blake&mdash;an honest fellow&mdash;looked into
Clarris’s face, and saw that he spoke the truth.</p>

<p>Then followed the last miserable interview
with Helen, and the hurried preparations for
flight. His wife entreated that she might go
away to her old home, under her uncle’s roof.
She had brought him nothing but trouble,
she owned piteously; and he would get on
better without her. Alas, poor Helen! a sorry
helpmeet she had been to the man who had
loved her! These two had not asked the
Lord to their marriage-feast, and had never
drunk of the wine of His love. And so they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
parted, never to meet again till they should
meet at the marriage supper of the Lamb.</p>

<p>In Melbourne there was one Ralph Channell,
who had been the friend of Robert’s father,
and the miserable man found him out. He
told Mr. Channell his whole story. Nothing
was concealed. The sin, in all its hideousness,
was exposed to Ralph Channell’s sight. And
yet he took the sinner to his heart.</p>

<p>But he tested the young man patiently.
He let him scrape and save to pay back the
money that he had stolen; he would not give
him a single farthing. Every shilling of the
restored sum was fairly earned in Mr. Channell’s
service, and paid out of a small salary.
And all that time he saw that a mighty work
of grace was going on in Robert’s soul.</p>

<p>When Mr. Channell lay dying, a lonely,
childless man, he called Robert to his side.
“All my property is yours,” he said; <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>“you
are my sole heir, and you must take my
name&mdash;ay, and you must make it loved and
honoured in the old country.”</p>

<p>So Robert came to England, full of yearnings
for the child whom he had never seen.
From John Farren he learnt that Rhoda’s
heart was hardened against him. And yet,
how could he help loving her for the love
that she bare to Nelly? He knew all about
Rhoda from her mother’s letters. And he
wanted, more than he ever acknowledged, to
see this woman who could be so hard and
yet so tender. The opportunity came. He
bought the farm, and gave it to Farmer Farren;
only stipulating that it should go to Rhoda
at her father’s death. And he came to dwell
amongst the Farrens as Ralph Channell.</p>

<p>This was all that the mother had to tell.
Rhoda got up, when the tale was ended, and
went quietly out of the house.</p>

<p>The sun had just gone down; but there
was light in the west, where rosy cloud-islands
floated in a golden sea. And there was a
light in Rhoda’s face that gave her a new
charm.</p>

<p>She knew, by some subtle instinct, where<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
she should find Robert Channell. She ascended
the steep, winding lane, that led to
the old churchyard. How did she guess that
one woman’s harshness would send him to
the grave of another? How is it that women
go straight to a conclusion which a man could
only reach by a circuitous route?</p>

<p>He neither saw nor heard her coming.
His head was bent over that flowery mound,
and the grass deadened the sound of her feet.
She had been very brave until she found
herself by his side. And then all her strength
and courage suddenly fled. She had no words
to plead for forgiveness; she could only touch
his arm with her trembling hand, and call
him by the name that she had hated all these
years,&mdash;</p>

<p>“Robert!”</p>

<p>There was very little said just then. The
last glow was dying out of the skies, and the
dews were falling on Helen’s grave. But the
Lord lifted up the light of His countenance
upon them, and gave them peace.</p>

<p><span class = "smcap">The</span> little village seemed to lie asleep in the
August sunshine. From the upland where she
stood Nelly could see the columns of pale
smoke going up from cottage chimneys, but
nobody was astir in the gardens. It was noon.
Scarcely a flake of cloud relieved the intense
blue overhead; not a breath of wind fanned
the thick leafage in the copse behind her.</p>

<p>Nelly Channell was not sorry that the morning
was over. Like most people who have a
great deal of time on their hands, she was often
puzzled about the disposal of it. When she
had diligently practised on the piano indoors,
and had paid a visit to the little step-brother
and sister in the nursery, there was nothing
more to be done. She used sometimes to say
that this part of her life was like an isthmus,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>
connecting the two continents of schoolgirlhood
and womanhood.</p>

<p>On this morning she had carried a book out
of doors, and had read it from beginning to end.
It was a book that had been recommended to
her by Mrs. Channell. Nelly had a great
reverence for her stepmother’s opinion; but the
story had not pleased her at all. It was directly
opposed to all her notions of right and wrong.
She even went so far as to say to herself that it
ought never to have been written.</p>

<p>Nelly was a girl who generally spoke her
mind;&mdash;a little bluntly sometimes, but always
with that natural earnestness which makes one
forgive the bluntness. As the distant church
clock struck twelve, and the stable-clock repeated
the strokes, she turned and went into
the house.</p>

<p>It was a large handsome house, which her
father had built soon after his second marriage,
about twelve years ago. But although they
had coaxed the creepers to grow over the red
bricks, and wreathe the doors and windows,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
Nelly always maintained that it was not so
charming a place as the little vine-covered
cottage where she was born. The cottage was
still standing; she could see it from her father’s
hall-door. And she had only to cross two
fields and an orchard when she wanted to visit
the dear old man and woman who had sheltered
her in her childhood.</p>

<p>On the threshold of the house stood Mrs.
Channell with a light basket on her arm.</p>

<p>“I am going to the cottage to see mother,”
she explained. “I have been making a new
cap for her,&mdash;look, Nelly.”</p>

<p>She lifted the basket-lid, and afforded Nelly
a glimpse of soft lace and lilac ribbons.</p>

<p>“Why didn’t you let me make it, mamma?”
the girl asked. “I think you ought to use
these idle hands of mine, if you want to keep
them out of mischief.”</p>

<p>“I gave you a book to read this morning,”
Mrs. Channell replied.</p>

<p>“Yes. I have read it, and I don’t like it,”
said candid Nelly, stepping back to lay the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
volume on the hall table. “I will go with
you to the cottage, and we can talk it over.”</p>

<p>Arm-in-arm they walked through the sweet
grass, keeping under the shadow of the hedges
and trees. Mrs. Channell waited for the girl
to speak again.</p>

<p>“I don’t like the book,” Nelly repeated,
after a pause. “The writer seems to have
strange ideas. The hero&mdash;a very poor hero&mdash;is
false to the heroine. After getting engaged
to her, he discovers that he can never
love her as he loves another girl; and of course
she releases him from the engagement when
she finds out the truth. But instead of representing
him as the worthless fellow that
he was, the author persists in showing us that
he became a good husband and father. He
begins his career by an act of treachery; and
yet he prospers, and is wonderfully happy with
the wife of his choice! It is too bad.”</p>

<p>“Lewis Moore was not a treacherous man,”
said Mrs. Channell, quietly. <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>“He made a great
and terrible mistake. But sometimes it is not
easy to distinguish between a blunder and a
crime. The heroine&mdash;Alice&mdash;had grace given
her to make that distinction. She saved him
and herself from the effects of the blunder by
setting him free. She bade him go and marry
Margaret, because she saw that Margaret was
the only woman who could make him happy.”</p>

<p>“He didn’t deserve to be happy!” cried
Nelly. “He ought to have been sure of himself
before he proposed to Alice. If I had
been in Alice’s place I would have let him
depart, but not with a blessing! She took it
far too tamely. I would have let him see that
I despised him.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Channell thought within herself that
the young often believe themselves a thousand
times harder-hearted than they are. Those
who feel the bitterest wrath when they think
of an injury that has never come to them are
the most patient and merciful when they
actually meet it face to face. But she did
not say this to Nelly.</p>

<p>The book was talked of no more that day;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
and for many a day afterwards it stood neglected
on Mrs. Channell’s shelves. Nelly had
forgotten it after a night’s sleep, and the next
morning’s post brought her a surprise.</p>

<p>When she entered the breakfast-room her
father was already seated at the table looking
over his letters. He held up one addressed,
in a legal-looking hand, to Miss Ellen Channell.</p>

<p>“Who is your new correspondent, Nelly?”
he asked. “This is something different from
the young-ladyish epistles you are in the habit
of receiving, isn’t it?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know the writing,” she said, opening
it carelessly. But in the next minute she
laid it hastily before him.</p>

<p>“Read it, father,” she cried. “Old Mr.
Myrtle is dead, and has left me three thousand
pounds! You remember how he made
a pet of me in my school-days?”</p>

<p>Mr. Channell read the letter in silence; and
then he looked up quickly into his daughter’s
face, and put his hand on hers.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span></p>

<p>“I hope no one is defrauded by this legacy,”
he said, gravely. “You will have quite enough
without it, Nelly. Had Mr. Myrtle any relations?”</p>

<p>“He used to say that he was quite alone
in the world,” she answered. “His house was
next to our school, and the gardens joined;
that was how I came to see so much of him.
No one ever went to stay with him, and he
seldom had even a caller.”</p>

<p>“I wish he had left the money to a poorer
girl,” remarked Mr. Channell. “Well, Nelly,
you will now have a hundred and fifty pounds
a year to do as you like with. I hope you’ll
spend it wisely, my dear.”</p>

<p>It was generally known throughout the
county that Nelly was the daughter of a rich
man. She was very pretty too, although not
so beautiful as her mother had been; and at
nineteen she was not without would-be suitors
and admirers. But not one of these was a man
after Robert Channell’s own heart. They
were hunting and sporting country gentlemen,
who talked of dogs and horses all day long.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>
He wanted a man of another stamp for Nelly.
He did not care about long pedigrees, nor did
he hanker after ancestral lands. He desired
for his child a husband who would guide a
young wife as bravely up the hill of Sacrifice
as over the plain called Ease.</p>

<p>It might have been that Robert Channell
thought too much of what the husband should
be to the wife, and too little of what the wife
is to the husband. There are moments in the
life of the strongest men when only the touch
of a woman’s hand has kept them from turning
into a wrong road. But it is not easy for a
father, anxious for the safety of his girl’s
future, to think of anything beyond her requirements.
Nelly was a prize; and Mr.
Channell could but daily pray that she might
not be won by one who was unworthy of her.</p>

<p class = "faux_h"> CHAPTER <abbr title="12">XII.</abbr> </p>

<p class = "chapter_name">MORGAN FOSTER, THE NEW CURATE.</p>


<p><span class = "smcap">In</span> the golden harvest time, just after they
had celebrated Nelly’s nineteenth birthday,
a new face appeared in Huntsdean, and a
new influence began to work among the
villagers. The rector, who had grown old
and feeble, was at last induced to secure the
services of a curate. And Robert Channell,
having been a good friend to the people for
many a day, felt almost disposed to look
jealously upon the stranger.</p>

<p>But before a month had passed by, Mr.
Channell and the curate had found out that
they were of one mind. The new-comer did
not want to upset any of the old plans, but
he showed himself capable of improving them.
He was no shallow boy, inflated with vast
notions of his own self-importance, but a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
thoughtful, active man, whose wisdom and
experience were far beyond his years. And
Robert liked Morgan Foster all the better because
he was the son of poor parents, and had
worked hard all his days, first as a grammar-school
boy, and then as a sizar at Cambridge.</p>

<p>Nelly liked his sermons, which were never
above her comprehension; and yet she liked
him none the less, perhaps, because her instincts
told her that he could have soared
higher if he had chosen. She fell into the
habit of comparing him with all the men she
had ever known, and found that he always
gained by the process.</p>

<p>Even in person this son of the people could
hold his own against the descendants of the
old county families. He was a tall, broad-shouldered
man; and Nelly, whose stature
was above middle height, secretly took a
pleasure in feeling that she must look up to
him. They were seen walking side by side
along the Huntsdean lanes, and folks began
to say that they were a fine couple.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span></p>

<p>Those calm autumn days were very sweet
days to Nelly Channell. The summer lingered
long; no wild winds suddenly stripped the
trees, and so the woods kept their leafiness,
and stood, in all their gorgeous apparel, under
the pale blue skies. Nelly thought it must be
the peace of this slow decay and tranquil sunshine
that made her life so happy at this time.
She did not own to herself that every bit of
the old scenery had become dearer because
Morgan Foster was learning to love it too.
Her father and mother discovered the secret
long before she had found it out; and they
smiled over it together, not ill-pleased.</p>

<p>She had more than one offer just at this
period. The neighbouring country houses
were full of men who had come to Huntsdean
for the shooting. They admired Nelly riding
by her father’s side, and looking vigorous and
blooming in her habit and hat. They met her
now and then at a dinner-party, and straightway
fell in love with her chestnut hair and
brown eyes, and were not unmindful of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>
handsome dowry that would go with these
charms. She was wont to say, long afterwards,
that her unconscious attachment to
another was a safeguard of God’s providing.
Many a woman speaks the fatal Yes, because
her heart furnishes her with no reason for
saying No.</p>

<p>Robert Channell encouraged the curate to
come often to his house; but no one hinted
that he thought of him as a possible son-in-law.
It was too absurd to suppose that he
would give his Nelly to a man who had only
a hundred-and-fifty a year, and was encumbered
with an old father and mother, living in
obscurity. Some of the disappointed suitors
remarked that Channell was a fool to have
the parson hanging about the place;&mdash;there
was no counting on the whims of a spoiled
beauty, who might take it into her head to
fling herself away on a curate. But this notion
was not generally entertained, and the intimacy
increased without exciting much notice.</p>

<p>Christmas had come and gone. It was the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
last day of the old year; Nelly, sitting alone
by the drawing-room fire, was seriously taking
herself to task, and asking her own heart why
the world was so very desolate that day? True,
the ground was covered with snow; but the
afternoon sky was bright with winter sunshine.
The brown woodlands took rich tinges from
the golden rays that slanted over them, and
scarlet berries glistened against the garden
wall. Nelly had wrapped a shawl round her
shoulders, and had laid the blame of her low
spirits on a cold.</p>

<p>“But the cold is not to blame,” owned the
girl to herself. “When one has a friend&mdash;such
a friend as Mr. Foster&mdash;one does not
like him to stay away from the house for a
week; and one cannot bear to hear that he
is always at the rectory when Miss White is
there! And yet it ought not to matter to
me!”</p>

<p>It mattered so much that the tears in Nelly’s
brown eyes began to run down her cheeks.
At that very moment the drawing-room door<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>
was thrown open, and the page announced
Mr. Foster.</p>

<p>The curate advanced a few paces, and
stopped in sudden dismay. There was something
so pathetic in Nelly’s pale, tearful face,
that he was stricken speechless for a moment.
And then he recovered himself, and began to
make anxious inquiries which she scarcely
knew how to answer.</p>

<p>“Nothing has happened, Mr. Foster,” she
sobbed. “I am only crying because I am in
low spirits.”</p>

<p>“Shall I go away now, and call to-morrow?”
asked the bewildered young man in his embarrassment.</p>

<p>“No,” said Nelly, suddenly looking up
through her tears; “I shall be a great deal
worse if you leave me to myself!”</p>

<p>Her face told him more than her words. In
a moment the truth flashed upon him, and
covered him with confusion. A vainer man,
or one less occupied in earnest work, would
have seen it far sooner. Morgan Foster took<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>
a chair by her side, and felt his heart throbbing
as it had seldom throbbed before. There
was but one thing to be done, and he was
going to do it.</p>

<p>There is no need to tell what he said.
Perhaps it was not a very impassioned declaration;
but it made a happy woman of
Nelly. And only a few minutes later Mr.
Channell and his wife returned from a wintry
walk, and found the two young people together.
There were no concealments; Morgan
was too honourable, and Nelly too simple-hearted,
to make a secret of what had taken
place. It was all talked over quietly, but
with a good deal of restrained feeling; and,
then, having declined an invitation to dinner,
the curate went his way.</p>

<p>He scarcely knew himself in the character
of an engaged man. He had been working
so hard all his life that marriage had been a
very distant prospect to him. While there
were the dear old parents to be helped, how
could he think of taking a wife? And now,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>
here was a rich girl willing to marry him;
and here was her father actually consenting
to the match with evident satisfaction! But
Nelly was something better than an heiress;
she was a very sweet woman; such a woman
as any man would have been proud to win.</p>

<p>So Morgan Foster, as he walked back to
his lodging over the frozen snow, began to
wonder at the good gifts that Heaven had
showered upon him. It was a strange fact
that he was more inclined to wonder than to
rejoice.</p>

<p class = "chapter_name">WHAT A LITTLE POEM REVEALED.</p>


<p><span class = "smcap">Lovers</span>, like sinners, are nearly always found
out; and in a very short time everybody knew
that Nelly Channell was engaged. It is not
worth while to record all the remarks that this
affair drew forth. They were comments of the
usual kind; the curate was called a schemer,
and the father was said to have cruelly neglected
the interests of his child. But as none
of these observations reached the ears of those
whom they chiefly concerned, nobody was any
the worse for them.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Morgan took his good fortune in
a very tranquil way. He saw Nelly nearly
every day, and she did most of the talking that
went on between them. Her conversation, like
herself, was always simple and bright; it did
not weary the listener, and yet it sometimes set<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>
him wondering at the ease with which she
opened her heart, and let out its inmost
thoughts. He was conscious that he had never
let her get beyond the vestibule of his inner
self; but he would fain have had it otherwise.
It pained him, even while it comforted him, to
see that she was quite unaware of his involuntary
reserve. Had she known that he kept any
locked-up chambers, she would have striven to
find the keys, and would most likely have
succeeded. But she did not know it. She
possessed no instinct keen enough to tell her
that she might live with this man for years
without once getting close to his soul.</p>

<p>“Read this, Nelly,” he said, one February
afternoon. He had called to take her out
walking, and they were standing together at
the drawing-room window. All the snow was
gone, and in its stead there were clusters of
snowdrops scattered over the brown mould.
Here and there was a group of the golden-eyed
polyanthus; a little yellow-hammer, perched on
the garden-wall, piped its small, sweet song.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>
There was sunlight out of doors, and Nelly,
looking bright and picturesque in her velvet
and sable, was impatient to leave the house.</p>

<p>Morgan had taken a copy of the <cite>Monthly
Guest</cite> from his pocket and was pointing to a
little poem on one of its pages.</p>

<p>“I can read it when we have had our walk,”
Nelly answered. Then catching a slight shade
of disappointment on his face, she gave her
whole attention to the verses at once.</p>

<p>“How pretty!” she said, having conscientiously
travelled through the thirty lines.
“How strange it seems that some people
should have the power of putting their ideas
into rhyme! The writer has a nice name,&mdash;Eve
Hazleburn.”</p>

<p>“Perhaps it is merely a <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">nom-de-plume</i>,”
replied Morgan, returning the journal to his
pocket.</p>

<p>Nelly thought within herself that she had
never found her lover a pleasanter companion
than he was that day. He amused her with
little stories of his college life, and even went<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>
back to his grammar-school days in search of
incidents. It was a delightful walk; twilight
was creeping on when they found themselves
at the house-door again, but Morgan came no
farther than the threshold.</p>

<p>“No, thank you,” he said; “I cannot dine
with you to-night; I must go home and write
letters. Good-night, Nelly dear.”</p>

<p>He went his way through the leafless lanes,
past the cottages and gardens, to the old
sexton’s ivy-covered dwelling. Then he lifted
the latch and went straight to the little parlour
that had been given up to his use. It was a
very small room, so low that the beam across
the ceiling was blackened and blistered by the
heat from the curate’s reading lamp. Six rush-bottomed
chairs stood with their backs against
the wall, and a carpet-covered hassock was the
sole pretension to luxury that the apartment
contained. But a cheerful fire was blazing in
the grate, and on a little red tray stood a
homely black teapot.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span></p>

<p>“I saw you a-comin’ through the lane, sir,
and I’ve boiled an egg for you,” said his good
landlady, bustling in. “It’s bitter cold still.
My good man hopes you’ll keep your fire up.”</p>

<p>She went back to her own quarters with a
troubled look on her kindly old face. Somehow,
her lodger did not seem quite so bright
as he ought to have been after taking a walk
with his sweetheart. She thought they must
have had a lovers’ quarrel; and, woman-like,
was disposed to lay the blame thereof on her
own sex.</p>

<p>“All girls is fond of worritin’ men; high or
low, rich or poor, they’re all alike,” she said,
to her husband. “They don’t like going on
too peaceable. Nothin’ pleases ’em so well as
a bit of a tiff now and then. But if Miss
Channell don’t know when she’s well off, she’s
a foolish body;&mdash;women are a’most as bad as
the children of Israel, a-quarrelling with their
blessings!”</p>

<p>While the sexton’s wife was misjudging poor
unconscious Nelly, the curate sat lingering over
his tea-cup. He was thoroughly realizing, for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span>
the first time, that he had made a mistake in
asking Miss Channell to be his wife. It was a
little thing that had opened his eyes to the
blunder,&mdash;merely her way of reading the little
poem in the <cite>Monthly Guest</cite>. He had been
always vaguely hoping that something would
bring them nearer together, and make it
possible for him to give all that he ought to
give; and he had thought that the poem
would do it. The verses seemed to have
proceeded straight from some human heart,
whose feelings and aspirations were identical
with his own. They expressed the same sense
of failure and hope which every earnest worker
for God must feel. They described the peace
which always grows out of hearty effort, even
if that effort be not a success.</p>

<p>Just one word or look of comprehension
would have led him on to speak out of his interior
self. But poor Nelly saw nothing in the
poem beyond its rhymes. She was like one
who misses the diamond in gazing at its setting.</p>

<p>“Thank God!” he said, half aloud, <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>“that I
can hide my sense of disappointment from her!
She shall never know that I want anything but
her sweetness and goodness, poor child! What
a happy man I ought to be, and yet what an
ungrateful wretch I seem in my own eyes!”</p>

<p>He sat looking sadly into the red hollow of
the neglected fire and sighed heavily.</p>

<p>“I am like old Bunyan’s pilgrims,” he continued.
“I remember that they came to a
place where they saw a way put itself into their
way, and seemed withal to lie as straight as the
way which they should go. And now I fear
that I have gone out of my right path without
knowing it. Well, so long as the penalty falls
upon me only, I can bear it!”</p>

<p>But his spirit was still disquieted when he
went to his little chamber that night. He lay
awake for hours thinking of Nelly, and of the
future which lay before them both.</p>

<p>Next morning came a letter, in his father’s
handwriting, which was full of sad tidings. His
mother was dangerously ill;&mdash;could he not
come to her at once?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span></p>

<p>Morgan went straightway to the rectory, and
laid his case before the rector. The old man
had his son, a young deacon, staying in his
house, and readily consented to spare his curate.
Then there was a letter to Nelly to be written,
explaining the cause of his sudden departure.
Before noon the train was bearing him far away
from the vales and woods of Huntsdean,
straight to the great world of London. And
from Euston Square he travelled to the ancient
Warwickshire city where his parents had made
their home.</p>

<p class = "chapter_name">EVE HAZLEBURN, POET AND FRIEND.</p>


<p><span class = "smcap">A very</span> humble home it was; but his love
had stinted self to obtain comforts for them.
The light of the February day was fading when
he entered the little house, and found his father
eagerly watching for him.</p>

<p>“You are a good son,&mdash;a good son,” said the
old man, in a broken voice. “She is no worse;
and Miss Hazleburn is with her.”</p>

<p>Hazleburn! The name had a familiar
sound; but Morgan was too weary and agitated
to remember where he had heard it
before. He took his way at once to his
mother’s chamber.</p>

<p>As he went in, a small, slight figure rose
from a chair by the bedside, and quietly glided
away. He scarcely looked at it in the gathering
dusk; moreover he had no thoughts, just<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>
then, for anybody but the mother who lay there
yearning for a sight of him.</p>

<p>His coming seemed to do Mrs. Foster good,
and give her a new hold upon life. It was a
low nervous fever that had seized upon her,
taking away her strength by slow degrees, until
she had grown almost as helpless as an infant.
But God had sent her a friend in Eve Hazleburn.
And before he slept that night, Morgan
had heard from his father’s lips the story of
Miss Hazleburn’s unselfish kindness.</p>

<p>Eve was one of those friendless beings who
are thrown entirely on their own resources, and
often get on better than the more favoured
children of fortune. She had an easy post as
governess in the family of Mr. Gold, a rich
Warwickshire merchant;&mdash;too easy, as she
sometimes said. For the little Golds had
holiday two or three times a week, and were
not on any account to be burdened with long
study hours. The house was in a perpetual
bustle; visitors constantly coming and going.
But if her employers were unjust to themselves,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>
they were far from ungenerous to Eve. They
would fain have had her share in all their feastings
and merry-makings, and laughed and wondered
at her liking for retirement and peace.</p>

<p>There had been sickness in their household.
Soon after Christmas the whole family had
gone away to a sheltered watering-place, leaving
Miss Hazleburn in charge of the house, and
of the two servants who remained in it.</p>

<p>She had not made many friends in the city of
C&mdash;&mdash;. Her Sundays were her own, and her
services in the Sunday-school had won gratitude
and approval from the vicar of the parish.
She went occasionally, but not often, to the
vicarage.</p>

<p>The acquaintance between Morgan’s parents
and herself was nearly a year old. Their quiet
street ran along at the back of the merchant’s
great house, and Eve had watched the pair
sometimes from her chamber window. Then
there was a chance meeting, a slight service
rendered, and the governess became their
friend and frequent visitor.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span></p>

<p>The absence of the Golds left her at liberty
to nurse Mrs. Foster in her illness. The
servants, being sober and trustworthy, required
little watching, and Eve’s time was her own.
None ever knew what it cost her to give up all
her leisure to the sick woman; none guessed
that a cherished plan was quietly laid aside for
Mrs. Foster’s sake. The manuscript which Eve
had hoped to complete in these holidays of
hers was put by. An inner voice told her that
God meant her to use her leisure in another
way; and Eve’s life was so still, so free from
turmoil and passion, that she could always hear
the voices that spoke to her soul.</p>

<p>Days went and came. The old rector of
Huntsdean wrote kindly to his curate, bidding
him stay in Warwickshire as long as his mother
needed him. Nelly wrote too; such simple
loving letters that every word went like a stab
to Morgan’s heart. She also begged him not
to hasten his return for her sake. It was good
for her, her father told her, to have this slight
dash of bitterness in a cup that had been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>
over-sweet. And poor Nelly made so great a
show of heroism over this little trial of hers,
that those of her own household smiled.</p>

<p>Meanwhile Eve and Morgan met every day;
and he talked to her about her poem, which
was the only production of hers that had as
yet found its way into print. The poem was
the starting-point from whence they travelled
on into each other’s experiences. Ah, how
easily and quickly people glide into familiar
intercourse when there is a spiritual kinship
between them! Poor Morgan’s heart opened
to Eve as naturally as a flower uncloses to the
sun. Yet he never suspected that this was the
beginning of love.</p>

<p>The curate had not told his parents of his
engagement. He had been morbidly afraid
that it would put a sense of distance between
the old people and himself. Therefore he
had said nothing about it in his letters, but
had waited till he should see them face to
face. But now that the time had come, he
feared to make the disclosure. His mother<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>
was in no condition to bear any startling
news. And as to Miss Hazleburn&mdash;of what
consequence could his affairs be to her? So
the intimacy went on. He was too blind to
see the injustice that he was doing Nelly and
Eve herself.</p>

<p>“We are really not very new friends,” he
said to the governess one day. “I knew you
through your poem. We met in the spirit
before we met in the flesh.”</p>

<p>“Nobody need be solitary nowadays,” answered
Eve, brightly. “I have many such
spiritual friends, whom I shall probably never
see with my bodily eyes. Don’t you think
that one of the joys of eternity will be in
finding out what we have done for each other
unconsciously? I am often unspeakably grateful
for the printed words that have helped me
on.”</p>

<p>“Do you find many companions in Mr.
Gold’s house?” he asked.</p>

<p>“No,” she said, frankly. <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>“You know what
it is to like people, and yet have no affinity
with them. The Golds’ life is a perpetual
pleasure-hunt. Parents and children join in
the chase from morning till night; there is
little rest or stillness in the house. I should
be scarcely sorry to leave it.”</p>

<p>“Are you thinking of leaving it?” Morgan
inquired.</p>

<p>“Not yet. Indeed, I have no other home,”
she answered. “I had a hope, last year, that
one might be provided for me; but that is
over now.”</p>

<p>They were sitting together in the Fosters’
little parlour while this talk went on. It was
Sunday afternoon; Mrs. Foster, now steadily
making progress towards recovery, was asleep
upstairs, and her husband had ventured out
to church. The sun was getting low; a yellow
light came stealing over the roofs of the opposite
houses, and shone full upon Eve’s face.
Her last words had been spoken in a sad
tone; her eyes looked dreamily out into the
narrow street.</p>

<p>She was very far from realizing the interpretation<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span>
that Morgan had put upon her
remark. Nor did she dream of the sudden
turmoil that was working within him, as he
sat watching her face.</p>

<p>She was not a pretty woman. She had the
charms that belong to symmetry of form, and
grace of manner and movement. But few of
those who were struck at once by Nelly Channell’s
beauty would have noticed Eve. They
would have failed to see the noble shape of
that small head, and the play of light and
shade on the careworn young face. Yet as
Morgan sat watching her, he was stung by the
sharpness of jealous agony. Had some man
wooed this girl, and been an accepted lover?</p>

<p>He could not endure the idea that those
chance words of hers had conjured up. The
grand passion of his life was revealed to him
in a moment. He knew what he felt towards
Eve, and knew, too, that this was what he
ought to have felt towards another. This was
love. It was but a poor counterfeit thereof
that he had given to Nelly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span></p>

<p>“Some people think nothing of breaking a
promise,” she continued, still looking out into
the street. “Years ago, when I was a child,
and my father was a prosperous man, his friend
Mr. Myrtle came to him in sore need of money.
My father lent him three thousand pounds.
The sum was lent without security, and it was
never repaid.”</p>

<p>Morgan breathed more freely; but he
thought of Nelly’s legacy.</p>

<p>“When my father felt himself to be dying,”
Eve went on, “he wrote to Mr. Myrtle, reminding
him once more of the debt. It was
for my sake that he did this, knowing that I
should be left quite friendless, and almost
penniless. And Mr. Myrtle promised to leave
me three thousand pounds in his will. He
died last year, Mr. Foster, but there was no
legacy for me.”</p>

<p>Morgan’s words of sympathy sounded flat
and commonplace. He was too much overcome
with shame to be conscious of what he
was saying. It was almost a relief when his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>
old father returned from church and broke up
the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">tête-à-tête</i>.</p>

<p>When Mrs. Foster was well enough to move
from her bed to a couch, the curate bethought
him of returning to Huntsdean. He did not
dare to think much of all that awaited him
there. He had lived a lifetime in the space
of a few weeks, and the village and its associations
looked unreal and far away. At this
time shame was his dominant feeling. He
forgot to pity himself for the blunder that he
had made&mdash;he thought only of his involuntary
treachery.</p>

<p>He did not dream of making any confession
to Nelly; she should be no sufferer through
this dreadful mistake of his. And he wrote
her as lover-like a letter as he could frame,
telling her that he was coming home in a
few days.</p>

<p><span class = "smcap">It</span> was the afternoon of Morgan’s last day
in Warwickshire. He sat by his mother’s
couch, holding her thin hand in his, and wishing,
with all his heart, that she were the only
woman in the world who had any claim upon
him. She looked at him with a long earnest
look; once or twice her lips opened, but some
moments went by before she spoke.</p>

<p>They were alone. Mr. Foster had pattered
off to the railway station, to seek for information
about the train by which Morgan was
to travel. As he sat there, with the dear
old woman who had shared all his early joys
and sorrows, he could not help longing to tell
her of his new trouble. But he knew not how
to begin. And then her gentle voice broke
the silence.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a><br /></span></p>

<p>“Morgan,” she said, “maybe I am going to
do a foolish thing. I never was a match-maker,
for I’ve always thought that God alone
ought to bring people together. But when
I see two who seem to be made for each other,
and one of them so near to me, how can I
help saying a word?”</p>

<p>“Speak on, mother,” he answered, drawing
a long breath. He knew what was coming.
Well, at any rate it would give him the opportunity
of unburdening his heart.</p>

<p>“I should like to see you engaged to Eve
Hazleburn,” she continued, gaining courage.
“She is as good as a daughter to me; but
that isn’t the reason that I want her for my
son’s wife. I want her, because there’s a sort
of likeness between you that makes me sure
you ought to be made one. And I’ve seen
your eyes follow her, Morgan, as if you thought
so too.”</p>

<p>“It cannot be, mother,” said the curate,
almost passionately. <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>
“It cannot be, and yet
I know it ought to be! I am already engaged
to another woman; but I love Eve Hazleburn
as I shall never love again!”</p>

<p>“God help us all!” sighed Mrs. Foster,
suddenly pressing his hand to enjoin silence.
It was too late. His voice had been raised
above its usual tone; and there stood Eve at
the open door.</p>

<p>He did not care&mdash;he was almost glad that
she knew all. There had come upon him the
recklessness that often arises out of hopelessness.
If he must wear his chain, she should
know what a heavy weight it was!</p>

<p>“Come in, Miss Hazleburn,” he said, rising
excitedly; “I am not sorry that you have
overheard me. Perhaps you will pity me a
little. Surely you can spare a grain of compassion
for the poor fool who has spoiled his
own life! I think you will, for you are a
good woman. Some women would glory in
a conquest of this sort, but you are not of
that number. Ah, I am talking nonsense, I
suppose.”</p>

<p>Eve went straight up to him and laid her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span>
hand upon his arm. She could not pretend
to have heard nothing, and she would not have
told a lie if she could. Her light touch stopped
him in his impatient walk up and down the
little room.</p>

<p>“Think of your mother, Mr. Foster,” she
said, softly. “She is not strong enough to bear
a scene.”</p>

<p>He sat down again by the couch, and buried
his face in the cushion on which Mrs. Foster’s
head rested. It was a boyish action; but Eve
knew that the best men in the world generally
keep a touch of boyishness about them. Her
heart ached for him as she stood looking down
upon the bowed head. And then the mother’s
glance met hers, and both women began to
weep silently.</p>

<p>“I’m a foolish old body,” said poor Mrs.
Foster. “It’s a mistake to go knocking at the
door of any heart, even if it’s that of one’s
child. I had better have held my tongue, and
left all to God.”</p>

<p>“It is better as it is,” Morgan answered<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>
raising his head, and speaking more quietly.
“I am less miserable than I was before. And
Miss Hazleburn will understand,” he added,
with a little pride, “that although I am an
unhappy man, I don’t mean to be a traitor.
I do not wish to recall anything I have said.
Every word was true; and now that she knows
all, she will pray for me.”</p>

<p>Eve stood before him and held out her
hand.</p>

<p>“I am going now,” she said. “God bless
you, Mr. Foster. You shall have all the blessings
that my prayers can win for you; and the
truest respect and friendship that a woman can
give. Perhaps we shall never meet again.
If we do, I think this scene will seem like a
dream to us both.”</p>

<p>She went her way out of the shabby little
house into the narrow street. Had God
nothing better to give her than this? Had
He shown her the beautiful land of Might-have-been
only to send her back, doubly
desolate, into the wilderness? These were the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span>
first rebellious questions that arose in Eve’s
heart, and it was some time before they were
answered.</p>

<p>Early on the following morning she went
to the window of her room, and looked between
the slats of the Venetian blind. It was chill
and grey out-of-doors. The sun had not yet
fully risen, and only a faint pallor was to be
seen in the eastern sky. Presently a fly
stopped at the door of that shabby little house
which she knew so well. Then the flyman
knocked; the door opened, and he entered,
soon reappearing with a <span lang = "fr" xml:lang = "fr">portmanteau</span>. Another
figure followed, tall and black-coated. At the
sight of it poor Eve uttered a low cry, and
pressed her hands tightly together. A moment
more, and the fly had rattled off down the
street, and had turned the corner on its way to
the railway station.</p>

<p>Was that to be the end of it all? Shivering
and forlorn, she went back to her bed, and lay
there for a time, mutely praying for strength
and peace.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span></p>

<p>Afterwards, she knew all that Morgan’s
mother could tell her about his engagement.
And she knew, too, that Nelly Channell was
the lady to whom Mr. Myrtle had left the three
thousand pounds. It seemed to her just then,
poor girl, as if Nelly were taking all the things
that ought to have been hers. But this mood
did not last long, and she was sorry that such
bitter thoughts should have found their way
into her heart. The Golds came back from the
seaside early in March, and the ordinary way
of life began again.</p>

<p>Morgan, too, had gone back to his work,
but it was harder for him than for Eve. She
had no part to sustain&mdash;no love to simulate.
And she had the consolation of his mother’s
friendship, and the sad delight of reading his
letters. In those letters no mention was ever
made of her; but they told of a life of daily
struggles&mdash;a life whose best comfort was found
in labour. Eve and Mrs. Foster wept over
them together, and clung to each other with
a new tenderness. The mother had faith, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span>
she believed that her son would be set free.
She ventured, once or twice, to say this to Eve,
but the girl shook her head.</p>

<p>“No,” she said, “we must not look for that.
We ought rather to pray that the ties may
grow pleasant instead of irksome.”</p>

<p>“I don’t know,” replied Mrs. Foster, thoughtfully.
“I almost think it is best to pray for
the freedom. It was not the right kind of
feeling, Eve, that led him to propose to Miss
Channell. He was startled into it, and it really
seemed at first as if that were the way that
God meant him to go.”</p>

<p>“He should have stood still, and just have
waited for guidance,” Eve remarked, sadly.</p>

<p>“Yes, I know that,” admitted the mother.
“But do not most of our troubles come to us
because we will not wait? We all find it
easier to run than to stand still.”</p>

<p>While these other hearts were throbbing with
restless pain, Nelly Channell was serenely
happy. She complained at times that Morgan
was working too hard, and wearing himself out,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>
but she never thought of attributing his wan
looks to any cause save that of over-exertion.</p>

<p>But Robert Channell had a keener sight;
and he began to ask himself, uneasily, if he
had been right in letting this engagement
come to pass? In his heart of hearts he owned
that he had been secretly anxious to secure
the curate for his daughter. It was the desire
of his life that Nelly should marry a good man,
and Morgan Foster was the best man that had
as yet come in her way. Perhaps he, too, had
been running when he ought to have stood
still. He began to think that this was the case.</p>

<p>But how could he undo what was done?
In his perplexity he talked the matter over
with his wife. And she admitted that the
curate did not seem to be quite at ease in
Nelly’s company. There was a shadow upon
him. It might be a consciousness of failing
health, or&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>“Or of failing love,” said Mr. Channell,
finishing her sentence. <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span>“If that is it, Rhoda,
it is a miserable affair indeed! We ought to
have made them wait before we sanctioned
the engagement. But you know I wanted
to keep her safe from those selfish, worldly
men who have been seeking her.”</p>

<p>“We are always afraid to trust God with
anything dear to us,” answered Mrs. Channell,
sadly. “But if Morgan Foster has mistaken
his own feelings, Robert, it will be hard to
condemn him, and equally hard to forgive him.”</p>

<p>Summer came. And early in July all the
gossips in Huntsdean were talking of the rich
family who had taken Laurel House. Mr.
Gold, they said, was a retired merchant from
Warwickshire, who was as wealthy as a nabob.
His household consisted of a wife and six
children, a governess, and menservants and
maidservants. And when Nelly heard that
the governess was a Miss Hazleburn, the name
awoke no recollections. She had quite forgotten
the little poem in the <cite>Monthly Guest</cite>.</p>

<p>The Channells called on the new-comers, and
were received by Miss Hazleburn. Illness kept
Mrs. Gold in her own room for some weeks<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span>
after her arrival in Huntsdean, and on Eve
devolved the unwelcome task of seeing visitors.
The one whom she most dreaded and most
longed to see did not come. She saw him in
church, and that was all. She had determined
that her stay in Huntsdean should be as short
as possible. Already she was answering advertisements,
and doing her utmost to get away
from the place. It was hard upon her, she
thought, that among the earliest callers should
be Nelly Channell.</p>

<p>Yet when she saw the girl she felt a thrill
of secret satisfaction. This, then, was the
woman before whom she was preferred; and
Eve’s eyes told her that she could no more
be compared with Nelly than a daisy can be
compared with a rose! But the poor daisy,
growing in life’s highway, unsheltered from the
storms of the world, was loved better than the
beautiful garden flower. She was human, and
she could not help rejoicing in her unsuspected
triumph.</p>

<p>Nelly took a girl’s sudden and unreasonable<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span>
liking to the governess. She wanted Miss
Hazleburn to be her friend; she talked of her
to everybody, including Morgan Foster.</p>

<p>“Have you seen her, Morgan?” she asked.</p>

<p>“I have seen her in church,” he answered.</p>

<p>“Then you haven’t called on the Golds yet,”
said Nelly. “Why don’t you go there?”</p>

<p>“The rector has called,” Morgan replied,
“and there really is no need for a curate to be
thrusting himself into rich folks’ houses unless
they are ill.”</p>

<p>“You didn’t mind coming to our house,”
rejoined Nelly, “and I daresay we are as rich
as the Golds. But you can’t judge of Miss
Hazleburn by seeing her in church, Morgan.
It is in conversation that you find out how
charming she is. And actually there is something
in her that reminds me of you! I can’t
tell where the resemblance lies&mdash;it may be in
the voice, or it may be in the face, but I am
certain that it exists.”</p>

<p>“It exists only in your imagination,” said
Morgan, bent upon changing the subject.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span></p>

<p>Before Mrs. Gold had entirely recovered,
Nelly had got into a habit of running in and
out of the house. It was about three-quarters
of a mile from her home, and stood on the
summit of the green downs which she had loved
in her childhood. The garden slanted down
from the back of the house to these open downs:
it was raised above the slopes and terminated in
a gravelled terrace; and so low was this terrace
that Nelly could easily climb upon it and go
straying into the shrubbery. She had done
this dozens of times while Laurel House was
empty, for the old garden, with its thick hedges
of laurel and yew, had always been a favourite
haunt of hers. Finding that the Golds were
free-and-easy people, who gladly welcomed the
pretty trespasser, she chose to keep up her old
custom.</p>

<p class = "chapter_name">HOW THE TRUTH CAME OUT.</p>


<p><span class = "smcap">One</span> August evening, when it was too sultry to
stay indoors, Nelly wandered out into the lanes
alone. She had told Morgan that she was
going to drive into the nearest town on a
shopping expedition, and should not return till
dusk. But one of her ponies had fallen lame,
and she had given up the plan.</p>

<p>On she went, saying a kind word or two to
the villagers as she passed their cottages.
They all loved Nelly well. Her bright face
came amongst them like a sunbeam; even the
smallest children had a smile for her as she
went by. She was so young and healthy and
beautiful that many an admiring glance
followed her tall figure. She belonged to
Huntsdean, and Huntsdean was proud of
her.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span></p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;">

<div class="caption"><p class="caption">On she went through the village.&mdash;Page 191.</p></div>
</div>

<p>She made straight for the downs, tripping
up the green slopes, and startling the browsing
sheep. She gave a friendly nod to the little
shepherd-boy who lay idly stretched upon
the grass. And then, as she had done often
enough before, she mounted the gravelled terrace,
and sat down on a rustic bench behind
the hedge of laurels.</p>

<p>From this spot she could not see Laurel
House at all. The high wall of evergreens
completely shut in the view of the residence
and its garden. The gravelled terrace was
divided from the grounds by this thick hedge,
and was only approached from the house by one
long straight path of turf. The path terminated
in an arch, formed by the carefully-kept shrubs,
and giving access to the platform; and any
one walking on the downs must go up to the
middle of the terrace and look through this
archway before he could get a glimpse of the
house.</p>

<p>Nelly knew that Miss Hazleburn liked to
walk up and down the turfy path when the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span>
day’s duties were done. She meant to rest herself
for a few minutes before entering the garden.</p>

<p>The bench was at the very end of the platform.
She loved the seat because it commanded
an extensive view of the surrounding
country. Beyond the Huntsdean downs she
could see other hills lying far away, softly
outlined against the summer evening sky.
And nearer lay the dearer old meadows and
homesteads and the long tracts of woodland,&mdash;all
familiar and beloved scenes to the girl
who had been born and bred among them.
The air was very still; even here it was but a
faint breath of wind that fanned her flushed
cheeks; but the coolness on these highlands
was delightful after the closeness of the vale.
She sat and enjoyed it in silence.</p>

<p>Quite suddenly the sound of voices broke
the stillness. The speakers were hidden from
Nelly’s gaze, for the tones came from the other
side of the laurel hedge. Eve Hazleburn’s
accents, clear and musical, could be recognised

<p>“I am going away next week,” she said,
“going back to Warwickshire, Mr. Foster, I
wrote to Mr. Lindley, the good Vicar of C&mdash;&mdash;,
and he has found a place for me. I am to
be companion to an invalid lady whose house
is close to the street where your father and
mother live. They will be glad to have me
near them again.”</p>

<p>She spoke rapidly, and a little louder than
usual. Nelly, overwhelmed with astonishment,
sat still, without giving a thought to her
position as an eavesdropper.</p>

<p>“I have kept away from you&mdash;I have tried
not to think of you!” cried Morgan Foster, in
irrepressible anguish. “God does not help me
in this matter. I have prayed, worked, struggled,
yet I get no relief. What shall I do,
Eve&mdash;what shall I do?”</p>

</div>

<p>“You must endure to the end,” she answered,
with a little sob. <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span>“God will make it easier by-and-by.
Oh, I was so sorry to come here, Mr.
Foster; but I could not help it! We will
never meet again, you and I. Yet I am glad
that I know Miss Channell. I will go and tell
the old people what a sweet bright girl she is;
and they will soon learn to love her. It will
all come right in the end.”</p>

<p>“Ah, if I could believe that!” said the
curate. “But I can’t. It is madness to think
that a wrong path can have a right ending.
Sometimes I am persuaded it would be best
to tell her everything.”</p>

<p>“If you did,” cried Eve, sternly, “you would
break her heart. And don’t think&mdash;pray don’t
think, Mr. Foster, that I would build my house
on the ruins of another woman’s happiness!
When I am gone,” and the proud voice
trembled, “you will learn to submit to circumstances.
We are not likely to cross each
other’s paths again; you will be a rich
man&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Oh, the money makes it all the harder to
bear!” interrupted Morgan, bitterly. <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span>“That
three thousand pounds that Mr. Myrtle promised
to leave to you has been left to her.
Did you know this?”</p>

<p>Nelly did not wait to hear Eve’s reply.
Swiftly and noiselessly she sprang from the
terrace on to the smooth sod beneath, her
muslin dress making no rustle as she moved.
Away she sped down the green slopes; the
sheep parted to left and right before her
flying footsteps; the shepherd-lad stared after
her in amazement. She did not take the road
that led through the village. In her misery
and bewilderment she remembered that she
could not bear the friendly good-nights of the
cottagers. She struck wildly across the fields,
regardless of the wet grass, and the brambles
that tore her thin skirts as she dashed through
the gaps in the hedges, until she came to the
side of the brook, where she was alone in her
grief. She was not thinking at all; she was only
feeling&mdash;feeling passionately and bitterly&mdash;that
she had been cruelly wronged and deceived.</p>

<p>“Oh those two!” she moaned aloud, as her
home came in sight. <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span>“The man whom I loved&mdash;the girl whom I would have made my
friend!”</p>

<p>Robert Channell and his wife were sitting
together in the library. He had been reading
aloud: Shakespeare still lay open on his knee,
and Rhoda occupied a low chair by his side.
They were talking, as happy married people
love to talk, of the old days when God first
brought them together.</p>

<p>While they chatted in low tones, the day
was fast closing in. The French windows
stood open, and the first breath of the night
wind stole into the room. A dusky golden
haze was settling down over the garden; the
air was heavy with flower-scents and the faint
odours of fallen leaves. Suddenly a great
shower of petals from over-blown roses drifted
through the casement, and Nelly swept in after
them.</p>

<p>She sank down on her knees, shivering in
her limp, wet dress, and hid her face in her
stepmother’s lap. And then the story was
told from beginning to end.</p>

<p>An hour later, Rhoda was sitting by
Nelly’s pillow, talking to her in the sweet<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span>
hush of the August twilight. Already the
heat of anger had passed away. The girl’s
thoughts had gone back, as Rhoda knew they
would, to that winter afternoon when Morgan
had asked her to become engaged to him.</p>

<p>“Mamma,” she said, piteously, “he has
never loved me at all. He gave me all he
could give; but it was only the silver, not
the gold. It is very, very humiliating, but it
is the truth, and it must be faced. To-night
when I heard him speaking to Eve Hazleburn,
I understood the difference between
love and liking. He liked me, and perhaps
he saw&mdash;more than I meant him to see! O
mamma, I was very young and foolish!”</p>

<p>It touched Rhoda to hear Nelly speak of
her old self in the past tense. Yet it was a
fact; the youth and the folly had had their
day. Nelly would never be so young again,
for sorrow takes away girlhood when it
teaches wisdom.</p>

<p>“I heard Eve say,” she went on, <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span>“that
she would never build her house on the ruins
of another woman’s happiness; and God
forbid that I should build mine on ground
that has never rightly belonged to me! But
I wish he had told me the truth. He has
done me a greater wrong in hiding it, than
in speaking it out.”</p>

<p>“Nelly,” said her stepmother, tenderly,
“we believe that Morgan has been a blunderer,
but not a traitor. We have blundered
terribly ourselves. We ought not to have let
the engagement take place until we had
tested the strength of his attachment. We
wanted to guard you from unworthy suitors;
and in taking you out of danger, we led you
into sorrow.”</p>

<p>“I was very foolish,” repeated Nelly, with
a sigh.</p>

<p>“Don’t forget,” Rhoda continued, <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span>“that
God can bless those whom He puts asunder,
as well as those whom He joins together.
It is better to dwell apart than to live together
with divided souls. He saw we were
too weak and stupid to set our mistake right,
and He has done it for us. While we were
gazing helplessly at the knot, He cut the
thread.”</p>

<p>It was on a Saturday evening that Nelly’s
love affair came to an end. She was in her
place in church on Sunday morning, and
during the rest of the day she kept much by
her father’s side. They had talked the
matter over and over, and had arranged all
their plans before the night closed in. And
Nelly thanked God that the anger had gone
away from her heart, although the sorrow
remained.</p>

<p><span class = "smcap">Very</span> early on Monday, the Golds’
governess took her departure from Huntsdean.
The train bore her away through the
pleasant southern counties while the dew was
still shining on the meadows. On and on it
went; past cottages, standing amid fruit-laden
trees, and gardens where Michaelmas
daisies were in bloom; past yellow fields,
where the corn was falling under the sickles
of the reapers. Hedges were gay with
Canterbury bells and ragged robins. Here
and there were dashes of gold on the deep
green of the woods. Eve Hazleburn, quiet
and tearless, looked out upon the smiling
country, and bade it a mute farewell.</p>

<p>Afterwards, two carriages laden with
luggage drove out of the village, taking the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span>
road that led to the neighbouring seaport
town. The first contained the two little
Channells and their nurses; in the second
sat Rhoda and Nelly. And before the
vehicles were out of sight, Robert Channell
had turned his steps in the direction of the
curate’s lodging.</p>

<p>He met the young man in the lane outside
the sexton’s cottage, and gave him a
kindly good morning.</p>

<p>“I am the bearer of startling news,
Morgan,” he said, slipping a little note into
his hand. “Let us come under the shade
of the churchyard trees. And now, Morgan,
before you read the note, I want to ask you
to forgive my Nelly.”</p>

<p>“Forgive Nelly!” stammered the curate,
thinking that if all could be known it would
be Nelly’s part to forgive him.</p>

<p>“Yes,” the father answered. <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span>“Try to
think of her as a dear, foolish child who
has made a grave mistake. She has sent
me to break off her engagement with you,
Morgan. She begs you, through me, to forgive
her for any pain that she may cause
you. She wants you to remember her kindly
always, but neither to write to her, nor seek
to see her again.”</p>

<p>The curate was silent for some moments.
No suspicion of the truth crossed his mind.
He concluded, not unnaturally, that he had
been too quiet and grave a lover for the
bright girl. That was all.</p>

<p>When he spoke, his words were very
few. Perhaps Nelly’s father respected him
none the less because he made no pretence
of great sorrow. His face was pale, and his
voice trembled a little, as he said quietly,&mdash;</p>

<p>“If you will come into my lodging, Mr.
Channell, I will give you Nelly’s letters and
her portrait. She may like to have them
back again without delay.”</p>

<p>They walked out of the churchyard, and
down the lane to the sexton’s cottage. And then
Morgan left Mr. Channell sitting in the little
parlour, while he went upstairs to his room.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span></p>

<p>The hour of release had come. He took
out a plain gold locket, which had always
been worn unseen, and detached it from its
guard. He opened it, and looked long and
sadly at the fair face that it contained. It
was a delicately-painted photograph, true to
life; and locket and portrait had been
Nelly’s first gift. The smile was her own
smile, frank and bright; the brown eyes
seemed to look straight at the gazer. “O
Nelly,” he said, kissing the picture, “why
couldn’t I love you better? Thank God for
this painless parting! No wonder that you
wearied of me, dear; you will be a thousand
times freer and happier without me.”</p>

<p>Presently he came downstairs, and entered
the parlour with the locket and a little
packet of letters. These he gave silently
into Mr. Channell’s hands.</p>

<p>“Morgan,” said Robert Channell, <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span>“I am
heartily sorry for this. Don’t think that I
shall cease to feel for you as a friend, because
I cannot have you for a son-in-law.”</p>

<p>“I shall never forget all your kindness,”
Morgan answered, in a low voice. “But I
shall soon leave this place, Mr. Channell.”</p>

<p>“Better so, perhaps,” Robert responded.
“You ought to labour in a larger sphere. You
have great capacities for hard work, Morgan.”</p>

<p>Then the two men parted with a close
hand-shake. And Mr. Channell looked back
to say, almost carelessly,&mdash;</p>

<p>“My family have migrated to Southsea for
a month or two. I follow them to-morrow.”</p>

<p>It would be too much to say that the
curate “regained his freedom with a sigh.”
Yet certain it is that this unlooked-for release
set his heart aching; it might be that his
<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">amour propre</i> was slightly wounded, for was
it not a little hard to find that the girl for
whom he had been making a martyr of himself
could do very well without him? He
had climbed the height of self-sacrifice only
to find deliverance. The spirit of sacrifice had
been required of him, but the crowning act
was not demanded.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span></p>

<p>He read Nelly’s note again. It was a very
commonplace little letter, written in a sloping,
feminine hand. She used that stereotyped
phrase which, hackneyed as it is, does as
well or better than any other, “I feel we are
not suited for each other.” This was the
sole excuse offered for breaking the engagement,
and surely it was excuse enough.</p>

<p>How could he know that these few trite
sentences had been written in the anguish of
a woman’s first great sorrow? We don’t
recognise the majesty of woe when it masquerades
in every-day garments. It needs a
Divine sight to find out the real heroes and
heroines of life. If Morgan had been questioned
about Nelly, the term “heroine” would
have been the very last that he would have
applied to her. And yet Nelly, quite unconsciously,
had acted in the true spirit of
heroism.</p>

<p>By-and-by the sense of relief began to make
itself felt, and Morgan’s heart grew wonderfully
light. He went through his usual routine of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span>
duties, and then took his way to the rectory.
He must give the rector timely notice of his
intention to resign his curacy.</p>

<p>Meanwhile Robert Channell had proceeded
to Laurel House. Mrs. Gold received him
in a depressed manner. Her governess, she
said, had left her; and she seemed to consider
that Miss Hazleburn had used her
unkindly. She did not know how such a
useful person could be replaced. Nobody
would ever satisfy her so well as Miss Hazleburn
had done. Yes, she could give the
governess’s address to Mr. Channell. She
had chosen to go to Warwickshire, to live
with an invalid lady. Mrs. Gold hoped she
would find the post unbearably dull, and
return to her former situation.</p>

<p>“There is little probability of that,” thought
Robert Channell, as he went his way with the
address in his pocket-book. And then he
thought of Nelly’s face and voice when she
had stated her intention of giving up Mr.
Myrtle’s legacy to Eve.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span></p>

<p>“I won’t keep anything that isn’t fairly
mine,” she had said; “let her have both the
lover and the money.”</p>

<p>Eve never ceased to wonder how the
Channells had found out that Mr. Myrtle
had owed her father three thousand pounds.</p>

<p>October had just set in when Eve and
Morgan met again. It was Sunday morning,
and she was on her way to that beautiful
old church which is the chief glory of the
city of C&mdash;&mdash;. The bells were chiming; the
ancient street was bright with autumn light;
far above them rose the tall spire, rising high
into the calm skies.</p>

<p>They said very little to each other at that
moment. A great deal had already been
said on paper, and they could afford to be
quiet just then. Together they entered the
church, a happy pair of worshippers, “singing
and making melody in their hearts to the
Lord.” “A thousand times happier,” Eve remarked
afterwards, “than we could ever have
dared to be if another had suffered for our joy.”</p>

<p><span class = "smcap">About</span> two years ago, a great crowd assembled
in one of the largest churches in London
to hear a popular preacher. He had, it was
said, a rare power of touching men’s hearts,
and of lifting their thoughts out of the mire
and clay of this working-day world. And
often, too, his wife’s name was coupled with
his; for she, by her written words, was doing
angels’ work among the people. Fashionable
society knew them only as preacher and
writer; but some of the unfashionable were
better acquainted with them.</p>

<p>In the crowd were two persons who
managed to get good seats in the middle
aisle. They were husband and wife; he a
brave soldier, she a beautiful woman. It
would not have been easy to have found a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span>
couple better matched, or better satisfied
with each other. They exchanged a quick
glance of intelligence when the preacher ascended
the pulpit stairs, and then composed
themselves to listen.</p>

<p>They were not disappointed in him. As
they listened, they understood how and why
he won such a ready hearing; and when the
sermon was over, Nelly turned to her husband
again with the old bright look; and he
answered her with a slight nod of satisfaction.
Then, and not till then, did she perceive a
familiar face at the top of the pew.</p>

<p>As Nelly looked once more on Eve,
there was revealed to her a strange glimpse
of what might have been if those two had
been kept apart, and she had taken Eve’s
place. She saw herself a restless, unsatisfied
wife, always craving for a vague something
that was withheld. She saw Morgan crippled,
not helped, by her riches; a good man still,
but one who had, somehow, missed his footing,
and failed to climb so high as had been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span>
expected of him. And she comprehended,
fully and thankfully, the great love and pity
of that Being who had saved them from their
mistake.</p>

<p>There was a quiet hand-clasp in the
crowded aisle; and then these two women
went their respective ways. And a voice
seemed to be ringing in Nelly’s ears, as she
leaned upon her husband’s arm.</p>

<p>“I am thinking,” she said, “of something
that was spoken long ago. It was when I
was in great trouble, dear, and felt as if I
couldn’t be comforted. ‘Don’t forget,’ my
stepmother said to me, ‘that God can bless
those whom He puts asunder as well as
those whom He joins together.’ And I think
I’m realizing the truth of those words to-night.”</p>

  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE

defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a

received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
